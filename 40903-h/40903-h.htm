<h3>UP A TREE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What a funny cow that is, Josh! Look at the
silly thing poking her bally old horns in the
ground, and throwing the dirt up. Say, did you
ever see anything like that? Why, the poor
beast must be sick, Josh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cow? Great Jupiter! Buster, you silly,
don&rsquo;t you know a bull when you see one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! and just think of me having the
nerve to put on my nice red sweater this morning,
because this Michigan air was so nippy. I don&rsquo;t
believe bulls like red things, do they, Josh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sure don&rsquo;t. And then we had to cut
across this field here, to save a few steps. He&rsquo;s
looking at us right now; we&rsquo;ll have to run for it,
Buster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat boy, who seemed to fully merit this
name, set down the bucket of fresh milk he had
been carrying, and groaned dismally.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t run&mdash;never was built for a sprinter,
and you know it, Josh Purdue!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;If he comes after us, I&rsquo;ve got to climb up this
lone tree, and wait till he gets tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then start shinning up right away, Buster;
for there he comes&mdash;and here I go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words long-legged Josh started off
at a tremendous pace, aiming for the nearest
fence. Buster, left to himself, immediately commenced
to try to get up the tree. He was so
nervous with the trampling of the bull, together
with the hoarse bellow that reached his ears,
that in all probability he might have been
caught before gaining a point of safety, only that
the animal stopped once or twice to throw up
some more soil, and thus give vent to his anger
at the intrusion on his preserves.</p>

<p>Josh got over the ground at an amazing rate,
and reaching the fence proceeded to climb over
the topmost rails; never once relinquishing his
grip on the package of fresh eggs that had just
been purchased from the farmhouse, to make a
delicious omelette for a camp dinner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after a tremendous amount of
puffing, and frantic climbing, the fat boy had
succeeded in getting a hold upon the lower limb,
and pulled himself out of the danger zone just
as the bull collided with the trunk of the tree.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Buster, as he hugged his
limb desperately; &ldquo;what an awful smash that
was! And hang the luck, he&rsquo;s just put his foot
in our pail of milk too. There goes the shiny
tin bucket the farmer loaned me, flying over the
top of the tree, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He presently managed to swing himself around
so that he could sit upon the limb and look down
at his tormentor. The bull was further amusing
himself by tearing up a whole lot more of the
turf, and bellowing furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad just because you didn&rsquo;t get me, ain&rsquo;t
you, mister?&rdquo; mocked Buster; whose name was
really Nick Longfellow, strange to say, considering
how short and stout nature had made him.</p>

<p>The bull did not bother answering, so after
watching his antics for a minute, and wondering
if he, too, would have been tossed over the tree
had he been caught, Nick remembered that he
had had a companion in misery.</p>

<p>Upon looking across the field he saw Josh
perched on the rail fence, surveying the situation,
craning his long neck to better observe the movements
of the animal, and ready to promptly drop
to the ground at the first sign of danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Josh! ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to help a feller?&rdquo;
shouted the prisoner of the lone tree in the pasture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course I&rsquo;d like to, Buster; but tell me, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
can I do?&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;Perhaps now
you&rsquo;d like to have me step inside, and let the old
thing chase me around, while you scuttled for
the fence. What d&rsquo;ye take me for, a Spanish
bull-baiter? Well, I ain&rsquo;t quite so green as I
look, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Josh,&rdquo; replied the fat boy with
emphasis; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s lucky you ain&rsquo;t, &rsquo;cause the
cows&rsquo;d grabbed you long ago for a bunch of
juicy grass. But why don&rsquo;t you do something
to help a feller out of a hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what I can do, and I&rsquo;ll think about
it, Buster,&rdquo; answered the other; as though not
wholly relishing the remark of his comrade, and
half tempted to go on his way, leaving the luckless
one to his fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only had my red sweater now, Josh,
you might toll the old feller to the fence, and
keep him running up and down while I slipped
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, send it over to me then,&rdquo; replied the
tall boy, with a wide grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just know I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared the prisoner.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish I had wings right now; or somebody&rsquo;d
drop down in an aeroplane, and snatch
me out of this pickle? But I suppose I&rsquo;ll have
to get up a way of escape myself. Don&rsquo;t I want
to kick myself now for not thinking about a
packet of red pepper when I was at that country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
store down near Pinconning yesterday. Never
going to be without it after this, you hear, Josh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only recently Nick had read an account of how
a boy, on being hard pressed by a pack of several
hungry wolves, somewhere in the north, had
shown remarkable presence of mind in taking to
a tree, and then scattering cayenne pepper in the
noses and eyes of the fierce brutes as they jumped
up at his dangling feet.</p>

<p>In that case the brutes had gone nearly crazy
with the pain, and the boy easily made his way
home. The story had impressed Buster greatly,
and that was why he now lamented the fact that
he had no such splendid ammunition to use on
the bull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, suppose you toss down that red sweater
to him,&rdquo; suggested Josh, making a speaking
trumpet of both his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good would that do?&rdquo; demanded the
captive, plaintively; for he was unusually fond of
the garment in question, and gloried in wearing
it; though after this experience he would be
careful about how he donned it again while
ashore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! he might take to tossing it around, and
perhaps run to the other side of the field. Then
you could sneak for the fence,&rdquo; called the one
who was safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and have him come tearing after me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
before I was half way there,&rdquo; cried Nick. &ldquo;I
guess not. Think of something easier. Can&rsquo;t
you coax him over there, Josh? Oh! please do.
I half believe you&rsquo;re as much afraid of him as I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says I am?&rdquo; retorted the other, at once
boldly jumping down inside the fence; upon
which the bull started on a gallop for that quarter,
and it was ludicrous to see how the valiant
boaster went up over that barricade again,
sprawling flat as he jumped to the ground.</p>

<p>Nick laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He near got you that time, Josh!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he the terror though? Look at him smash
at that fence. Better keep an eye out for a tree,
I tell you, if he breaks through. And Josh, for
goodness sake save the eggs. Our milk is gone,
the tin pail is ruined; but we don&rsquo;t want to lose
the precious eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few seconds later Nick broke out into a loud
wail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Josh,&rdquo; he called; &ldquo;I was only fooling
when I said that about you being afraid. Of
course you ain&rsquo;t; only it stands to reason nobody
wants to let that old bull get a chance to lift him
with those horns. Don&rsquo;t go away and leave
your best chum this way, Josh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chuck it, Buster,&rdquo; called back the other.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to desert you. But somebody&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
got to go after the farmer, and get him to come
and coax the bull to be good. You can&rsquo;t go, so
I&rsquo;m the only one left to do the job. Hold on
tight, and don&rsquo;t talk the bull to death while I&rsquo;m
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! bless you, Josh!&rdquo; called the captive of the
tree. &ldquo;I always knew you had a big heart. But
don&rsquo;t be too long, will you; because if he keeps
banging the trunk of this rotten old tree all the
time and chipping off pieces, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll get
it down yet. Hurry, now, Josh! Tell the farmer
what a mess I&rsquo;m in; and that he&rsquo;s just got to
bring out some feed, and coax his mountain of
beef to be good. Hurry, please, Josh, hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He watched the tall boy making his way leisurely
along, and groaned because Josh seemed
determined to let him have quite a siege of it
there.</p>

<p>The bull had come back, and was nipping the
grass almost under the tree. Now and then he
would move off a little distance, and deliberately
turn his back on Nick, as though he had forgotten
that such a thing as a boy existed. But the
captive was not so easily deceived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t Mr. Bull!&rdquo; he called, derisively.
&ldquo;I can just see you looking this way out of the
corner of your eye. Like me to slip down, and
try to make that old fence, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
Guess I&rsquo;d sail over the rails with ten feet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spare. But think what an awful splash there&rsquo;d
be when I landed. I can wait a while, till Josh
takes a notion to tell what he came back for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and he grew more and more
nervous. Long ago had his tall chum passed out
of sight behind the clump of trees that shut off
all view of the farmhouse. Nick half suspected
that Josh was lying down somewhere, resting,
perhaps in a place where he could watch what
went on in the pasture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t I wish I had wings now?&rdquo; he kept
mumbling, as he shook his head angrily, and
watched the movements of the bull. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fly
away, and let Josh think the ugly old beast had
swallowed me, that&rsquo;s what. He&rsquo;d be sorry then
he loafed, when I sent him for help. But is that
him coming over yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought he had detected something moving;
but it was at a point far removed from the
place where he expected Josh and assistance to
show up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, if it ain&rsquo;t George!&rdquo; he exclaimed
presently. &ldquo;He must have begun to
believe we were having too good a time at the
farmhouse; and is on his way over to get his
share. George is always looking for a pretty
girl. I&rsquo;ve got half a notion to let him get part
way across the field, and then holler at him.
When a feller is in a scrape it makes him feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
better to see somebody else getting it in the neck
too. There he comes across, sure enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bull had evidently seen George, too; but
as he happened to be standing half concealed by
the trunk of the tree just then, the boy who so
lightly started to cut across the pasture, meaning
to head for the house among the trees, failed to
discover the bull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my, won&rsquo;t he be surprised though!&rdquo;
muttered Nick, craning his fat neck in order to
see the better; for he did not want his friend to
get so far along that, in a pressure, he could not
gain the fence before the coming of the wild bull.</p>

<p>Now the beast had started to paw the ground.
George stopped short as he caught the sound,
and looked around him. Just then the bull tore
up some more turf, and tossed it in the air. That
meant he was primed to start on a furious rush to
overtake the newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, George!&rdquo; shrieked the boy in the tree,
at the top of his high-pitched voice. &ldquo;Run for
the fence! He&rsquo;s got his eye on you! The bull&rsquo;s
coming like hot cakes! Go it for all you&rsquo;re
worth, George. Oh! my! did I ever see such a
great lot of sprinting! George can run pretty
near as good as Josh did, and that&rsquo;s saying a
heap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was. George seemed to be making remarkably
fine time as he shot for that friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fence. Evidently George knew something about
bulls; enough at least not to want to stay in an
enclosure with an angry one, and interview him.</p>

<p>For a very brief period of time it seemed nip
and tuck as to whether George would be allowed
to get over that barrier unassisted, or be helped
by the willing bull. But apparently, after one
look over his shoulder at the approaching cyclone,
George was influenced to let out another
link, for his speed increased; and he just managed
to scramble over the rails when the bull came up
short against the fence, to look through with his
red eyes, and shake his head savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! where are you, Buster?&rdquo; shouted
George, after he had succeeded in getting his
breath again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, in this bally old tree, George. He
chased us, and I had to hustle up here, while
Josh went for help. He knocked my milkpail
to flinders; but thank goodness Josh saved the
eggs!&rdquo; cried Nick; whose greatest failing was a
tremendous appetite, that kept him almost constantly
thinking of something to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re a nice one,&rdquo; called the other.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you warn me sooner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m real sorry now I didn&rsquo;t, George,&rdquo; replied
Nick, as if penitent; though at the time he was
shaking with laughter, just as a bowl of jelly
quivers on being moved; &ldquo;but I was in hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
you&rsquo;d scare him off. When I saw him getting
mad, I knew he had it in for you; and then I
yelled. But George, please think of some way
to coax the old rascal off, won&rsquo;t you. It&rsquo;s awful
hard on me sitting up here on this limb, and he
means to stay till I just starve to death. Have
pity on me George and get up some plan to
rescue your best chum.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>THE CAMP IN THE COVE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hey, Buster,&rdquo; cried the one on the other side
of the fence, &ldquo;where did you say Josh was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went for help, over to the farmhouse
where we got the milk and eggs,&rdquo; answered the
boy in the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; George went on, after looking all
around. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see him coming any too fast;
and I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past that joker to take a
snooze on the way, so as to make you worry a lot
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was just thinking that same thing myself,
George. Josh has got it in for me, you know,
every time. But please think up some way to
toll this angry gentleman cow away, George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only had that red sweater now, I believe
it could be done,&rdquo; said George, presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that was what Josh said too,&rdquo; lamented
the prisoner; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you see I can&rsquo;t get it
over to you at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course not; but hold on there!&rdquo; called
George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! now I know you&rsquo;ve thought of an idea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Good for you, George! You&rsquo;re the best friend
a fellow ever had, when he was in trouble. Are
you going to sneak in the pasture, and tempt the
bull away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; promptly responded George.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got too much use for my legs, to take the
chances of being crippled. But wait and see
what I&rsquo;m going to do. Trust your Dutch uncle
to fool that old cyclone. Look at him tossing
the dirt up again. Oh! ain&rsquo;t he anxious to get at
me, though?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re shaking at him now?&rdquo;
demanded Nick. &ldquo;It looks like my sweater,
only I know yours is gray. Why, it must be a
bandanna handkerchief; yes, I remember now,
you often tie one around your neck, cowboy
fashion. I can see that you&rsquo;re going to get me
out of this nasty fix, George. It takes a lawyer
sometimes to beat a bull at his own game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a bandanna, Buster,&rdquo; replied the other,
&ldquo;and watch me coax the old fellow along the
fence, down to the other end of the field. How
he shakes his head every time I wave the red
flag, and tries to get at me. It&rsquo;s working fine,
Buster. You get ready to drop down and run
when I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But George, even if you coax him to the end
of the pasture you know I&rsquo;m so slow I never
could make the fence before he caught up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
me?&rdquo; cried the still worried prisoner of the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are like an ice wagon, Buster; but
never mind. I&rsquo;ve got all that fixed. Just look
down yonder and you&rsquo;ll see a nice little trap
ready for Mr. Bull. It&rsquo;s a small enclosure, with
three long rails to slide across, once he&rsquo;s inside.
Then he&rsquo;s caught fast, and can&rsquo;t get out. That
is meant for just such a purpose. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully! bully!&rdquo; shouted the delighted Nick,
waving his hat in the air. &ldquo;Oh! I tell you it
takes a smart fellow to get on to these dodges.
Why, Josh must have been blind not to see that
same thing. Look at the bull following you
every time you take a step. Then he turns his
old head to peek back at me, as if just daring me
to try and make the fence. But I know better.
I can wait. Why, George, talk to me about
your Spanish bull fights, this sure takes the
cake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crow too soon,&rdquo; answered the other
boy. &ldquo;Now comes the ticklish part of the game.
Will he go in that enclosure, or balk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wave it harder, George! Make out that
you&rsquo;re going to climb over. That&rsquo;s the way to
hold him. My! but wouldn&rsquo;t he like to pitch
you higher&rsquo;n a kite. Look at that piece of old
fence rail go flying, would you? Now he&rsquo;s inside,
George! Oh! if you can only get the bars
across!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>George proved equal to the emergency. He
fastened his red handkerchief to the fence, so
that the wind kept it stirring constantly, with
the bull snorting just on the other side, and
smelling of the flaming object. Then George
slily slipped back, took hold of the upper bar,
and quickly shot it in place through the opposite
groove.</p>

<p>A second immediately followed; and by the
time Mr. Bull awakened to the fact that he had
again fallen into the old trap, he found himself
neatly caged.</p>

<p>Nick was wild with delight. Still talking
aloud, partly to himself and also addressing
fulsome remarks to his chum, he started to slide
down the body of the tree, landing with a heavy
thump on the ground.</p>

<p>Then he went off at a pretty good pace, for
one so stout, heading for the nearest part of the
friendly fence.</p>

<p>Just about this moment, when Nick was half
way across the intervening space, who should
appear but Josh, followed by a farmer bearing
a measure of corn as a lure intended to entrap
the fighting animal.</p>

<p>All Josh saw was his friend trotting over the
field; and filled with sudden alarm lest poor Nick
be overtaken by the wily bull, whom he supposed
to be on the other side of the tree, he immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
broke out into a shrill shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run faster, Buster! He&rsquo;ll sure get you!
Put on another speed! Hurry, hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the fat boy heard these wild cries he
became visibly excited. It was all very well to
tell him to gallop along at a livelier clip; but
Nature had never intended Nick Longfellow for
a sprinter. When in his new alarm he attempted
to increase his speed, the consequence was that
his stout legs seemed to get twisted, or in each
other&rsquo;s way; at any rate he took a header, and
ploughed up the earth with his stubby nose.</p>

<p>It gave him a chance to roll over several times,
as if avoiding a vicious lunge from the wicked
horns of the bull, which animal he imagined must
be closing in on him.</p>

<p>Struggling to his feet, he again put for the now
near fence; and George nearly took a fit laughing
to see the remarkable manner in which the fat
boy managed to clamber over the rails, heedless
of whether he landed on his feet or his head, so
long as he avoided punishment.</p>

<p>When Josh came running down, accompanied
by George, Nick was brushing himself off, and
wheezing heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give you my word, Buster,&rdquo; said the long-legged
boy, penitently, &ldquo;I never saw that the old
duffer was caught in that trap when I yelled.
Thought he was only hiding behind the tree, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
giving you a fair start before he galloped after.
George, did you do that smart trick? Well, it
never came to me, I give you my word. Everybody
can&rsquo;t have these bright ideas, you know.
And Nick, I was bringing the farmer, with a
measure of corn, to get the bull to the barn.
Hope you don&rsquo;t hold it against me because I
yelled. I sure was scared when I saw you trotting
along so easy like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick was of a forgiving nature, and could not
hold resentment long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all right, Josh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No
great harm done, even if I have torn a big hole
in my trouser knee. But you stayed away a
mighty long while. Seemed like a whole hour to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Josh, with a twinkle in his eye,
&ldquo;not near as long as that. Course it seemed like
it to you, because a feller in a tree is worried. I
had some trouble finding the farmer, you know.
But let&rsquo;s go back and get some more milk. Here&rsquo;s
my eggs all sound. Never broke one, even
when I piled over this fence in such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest were of the same mind; so, accompanied
by the amused Michigan farmer, they
walked back to the house, where another purchase
was made. Not only did they get milk,
and another pail; but George thought to ask
about butter, and secured a supply for camp use.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>This time they avoided all short-cuts as tending
to breed danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard said that &lsquo;the longest way around
is the shortest way to the fire,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed George,
as they passed the trapped bull; &ldquo;but I never
knew it applied to cow pastures as well. Just
remember that, will you, Buster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as if I could ever forget those wicked
looking horns,&rdquo; answered the fat boy promptly.
&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll dream about that bull often. If
you hear me whooping out in the middle of the
night, boys, you can understand that he&rsquo;s been
chasing me in my sleep. Ugh! forget him&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In about ten minutes they came out of a grove
of trees, and before them lay the great lake
called Huron. Although it was something of a
cove in which a campfire was burning, beyond,
as far as the eye could reach, stretched a vast
expanse of water, glittering in the westering sun,
for it was late in the afternoon at the time.</p>

<p>Three natty little motor boats were anchored
in the broad cove, back of a jutting tongue of
land that would afford them shelter should a
blow spring up during the night from the northeast,
something hardly probable during early
August.</p>

<p>Near the fire a trio of other lads were taking
things comfortably. One of these was Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Stormways, the skipper of the <i>Tramp</i>; another
Jimmie Brannagan, an Irish lad who lived in the
Stormways home on the Upper Mississippi, as a
ward of Jack&rsquo;s father, and who was as humorous
and droll as any red-haired and freckled face boy
on earth; while the third fellow was Herbert
Dickson, whose broad-beamed boat was called
the <i>Comfort</i>, and well named at that.</p>

<p>George Rollins commanded the slender and
cranky speed boat which rejoiced in the name of
<i>Wireless</i>, and Josh acted as his assistant and
cook; while Nick played the same part, as well
as his fat build would allow, in the big launch.</p>

<p>They had spent a month cruising about the
Thousand Islands, where fortune had thrown
them in the way of many interesting experiences
that have been related in a previous volume.
Just now they were making a tour of the Great
Lakes, intending to pass up through the famous
Soo canal, reach Lake Superior, knock around
for a few weeks, and then head for Milwaukee;
where the boats would be shipped by railroad
across the country to their home town on the
great river.</p>

<p>As soon as the three wanderers arrived, laden
with good things, Josh, who was the boss cook
of the crowd, began to start operations looking
to a jolly supper on the shore.</p>

<p>There were a few cottages on the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the little bay; but just around them it was given
over to woods, so that they need not fear interruption
during their evening meal, and the singing
feast that generally followed.</p>

<p>Out in the bay a large power boat was anchored,
a beautiful craft, which the boys had
been admiring through their marine glasses.
Possibly the flutter of girls&rsquo; white dresses and
colored ribbons may have had something to do
with their interest in the costly vessel, though
neither Herb nor Jack would have confessed as
much had they been accused.</p>

<p>The name of the millionaire&rsquo;s boat was
<i>Mermaid</i>, and she was about as fine a specimen
of the American boatbuilder&rsquo;s art as any of these
amateur sailors had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me for a swim before we have supper,&rdquo; said
Nick; who felt rather dusty after tumbling
around so many times during his exciting experience
with the bull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you there, Buster,&rdquo; laughed Jack.
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve got an interest in your work,
since I taught you how to swim while we were
making that Mississippi cruise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the previous Fall, the high school in their
home town was closed until New Year&rsquo;s by order
of the Board of Health, on account of a dreadful
contagious disease breaking forth. These six
lads, having the three staunch motor boats, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
secured permission from their parents or guardians
to make a voyage down the Mississippi to
New Orleans. Jack really had to be in the
Crescent City on December 1st, to carry out the
provisions of the will of an eccentric uncle, who
had left him considerable property. The other
chums had gone along for the fun of the thing.
And it was this trip Jack referred to when speaking
of Nick&rsquo;s swimming.</p>

<p>Presently both boys were sporting in the
water, having donned their bathing suits. While
thus engaged Jack noticed out of the corner of
his eye that a boat had put out from the big
vessel, and also that the two girls were passengers.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were going ashore to take dinner
with friends at one of the cottages just beyond
the end of the woods; although Jack fancied that
the men rowing were heading a little out of a
straight course, so as to come closer to the three
little motor boats, and possibly give the fair
passengers a better view of the fleet.</p>

<p>There was now a stiff wind blowing, something
unusual at an hour so near sunset. The waves
came into the bay from the south, it being somewhat
open toward the lower end, and slapped up
on the beach with a merry chorus, that made
swimming a bit strenuous for the fat boy; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Jack, being a duck in the water, never minded it
a particle.</p>

<p>Intent on chasing Buster, whom he had allowed
to gain a good lead, Jack was suddenly thrilled
to hear a scream in a girlish voice, coming from
the boat which he knew was now close by.</p>

<p>His first thought was that one of the girls had
leaned too far over the side, and fallen into the
water, which at that point was very deep. And
it was with his heart in his mouth, so to speak,
that Jack dashed his hand across his eyes to
clear his vision, and turned his attention toward
the big power boat&rsquo;s tender.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>THE BOAT IN THE FACE OF THE MOON</h3>


<p>A single look told Jack another story, for after
all it was no human life in peril that had given
rise to that girlish shriek.</p>

<p>Upon the dancing waves he saw a pretty hat,
which had evidently been snatched by the wind
from the head of the golden-haired maid, who
was half standing up in the boat, with her hands
outstretched toward her floating headgear.</p>

<p>The men had started to change their stroke,
and try and turn the boat; but with the wind
blowing so hard this was no easy matter. The
chances seemed to be that possibly the hat might
sink before they could get to it.</p>

<p>Jack never hesitated an instant. No sooner
did he ascertain how things lay than he was off
like a shot, headed straight for the drifting hat.
It chanced that the wind and waves carried it
toward him at the same time; so that almost
before the two men in the boat had turned the
head of the craft properly, Jack was reaching out
an eager hand, and capturing the prize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; came in a chorus from the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ashore near the fire. Even Buster tried to wave
his hands, forgetting that he had full need of
them in the effort to remain afloat, with the
result that he temporarily vanished from view
under a wave.</p>

<p>Jack smiled to see the two girls in the boat
clapping their hands as they bore down upon
him. He noticed now, that while the one who
had lost her hat was slender and a very pretty
little witch, her companion was almost as heavy
in her way as Buster himself, and with the
rosiest cheeks possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! thank you,&rdquo; cried the maiden whose
headgear had been rescued from a watery grave.
&ldquo;It was nice of you to do that. And it was my
pet hat, too. Whatever would I have done if it
had sunk, with poor me so far away from our
Chicago home. Is one of those dear little boats
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the one with the burgee floating at the
bow,&rdquo; returned Jack, as he kept treading water,
after delivering up the gay hat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking
our vacation by making a trip from the Thousand
Islands all through the Great Lakes. My
name is Jack Stormways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine is Rita Andrews. My father owns
that big power boat there; and we live in Oak
Park near Chicago. This is my cousin, Sallie
Bliss. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that we&rsquo;re going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
leave here early in the morning; or I&rsquo;d ask you
to come aboard and meet my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick meanwhile was approaching, making
desperate efforts to hurry along before the boat
passed on. For Nick had discovered that the
rosy-cheeked girl was just the match for him,
and he wanted to be introduced the worst kind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the cruel men took to rowing
again, and though Nick swam after, puffing and
blowing like a porpoise, he was left in the lurch.
But he succeeded in waving his hand to the departing
ones, and laughed joyously when he saw
that Miss Sallie actually returned his salute.</p>

<p>So the boat with its fair occupants passed
away. Jack wondered whither the millionaire,
whose name he remembered having heard before,
was bound; and if a kind fate would ever
allow him to see that charming face of Rita
Andrews again. Little did he dream of the
startling conditions that would surround their
next meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! there, you fellows, come ashore and get
some duds on!&rdquo; called George, who had been an
interested observer of this little play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; supplemented Josh, waving a big spoon
as though that might be the emblem of his authority
as &ldquo;chief cook and bottle-washer,&rdquo; &ldquo;supper&rsquo;s
about ready, and my omelette eats best
when taken right off the pan. Get a move on
you, fellows.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>It was amusing to see the scramble Nick made
for the shore. The jangle of a spoon on a kettle
always stirred his fighting spirit; he felt the &ldquo;call
of the wild&rdquo; as George said, and could hardly
wait until the rest sat down.</p>

<p>So the two swimmers went ashore, and hastily
dressed. Nick was forever talking about the
lovely roses in the cheeks of Miss Sallie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t play fair, Jack,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;When you saw how anxious I was to get up,
why didn&rsquo;t you pretend to have a cramp, or something,
to detain the boat. I didn&rsquo;t even get
introduced. She don&rsquo;t know what my name is.
It&rsquo;s mean, that&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack knew that Buster would never be happy
unless he had some cause for grumbling. It was
usually all put on, though, for naturally the fat
boy was a good-natured, easy-going fellow, ready
to accommodate any one of his chums to the
utmost.</p>

<p>While they ate the fine supper which Josh
spread before them, George entertained the
party with a droll account of the adventure two
of their number had had with a bull. He had
purposely kept silent up to now, and bound Josh
to secrecy, so that he could spring the story
while they sat around.</p>

<p>Loud was the laughter as George went on in
his clever way of telling things. But Nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
laughed with the rest. Viewed from the standpoint
of safety things really looked humorous
now; whereas at one time they had seemed terrifying
indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch me wearing that blessed red sweater
again when I go for milk or eggs,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Once is enough for me. Oh! if I&rsquo;d only had a
camera along to snap Josh as he went climbing
over that fence, with the bull so close behind.
I&rsquo;d get that picture out every time I felt blue,
and laugh myself sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh assumed an injured air, as he spoke up,
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now would you listen to that, fellows? Just
as if I looked a quarter as funny as Nick did, trying
to scramble up that tree, nearly scared to
death, because he thought Johnny Bull wanted
to help him rise in the world. Oh! my land! but
he was a sight. When I went off to get help I
wanted to laugh so bad I just fell over in the
grass, where he couldn&rsquo;t see me, and just had it
out. Couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what kept you so long, was it?&rdquo; demanded
Nick, reproachfully. &ldquo;All right, the
very next time you get in a pickle, and yell out
for help, I&rsquo;m going to get a crick in my leg when
I try to run, see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same I noticed that you could swim to
beat the band when you tried to join Jack, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the sweet girlies got away,&rdquo; put in George, maliciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nick was afraid the boat was going to upset,
and he saw a chance to save that red-cheeked
little dumpling from a watery grave,&rdquo; Herb remarked,
with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose something <i>had</i> happened, Jack
couldn&rsquo;t have rescued them both. But you can
laugh all you want to, smarties, she waved her
hand to me all the same, didn&rsquo;t she, Jack?&rdquo; appealed
the fat boy, stubbornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her wave to somebody, so I suppose it
was meant for you,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Birds of a feather flock together,&rdquo; chanted
Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for you,&rdquo; Nick declared sternly.
&ldquo;She was a fine and dandy little lady, and I hope
some time in the future I&rsquo;ll see Sallie Bliss again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bliss! Oh! what d&rsquo;ye think of that, fellows?&rdquo;
roared George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave Buster alone, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Jack said,
in pretended indignation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, and
honest as the day is long. None of your Crafty
Clarence in his makeup, you know, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clarence Macklin was a boy who came from
the same town as those around the camp fire.
He was the son of a very rich man, who supplied
him with almost unlimited spending money.
Consequently Clarence was able to carry out any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
folly that chanced to crop up in his scheming
mind.</p>

<p>Learning through trickery of the intention of
the motor boat boys to cruise among the Thousand
Islands, he had shipped his fast speed boat,
called the <i>Flash</i> thither, and succeeded in giving
them more or less annoyance. He was accompanied
by his pet crony, a fellow called Bully
Joe Brinker, who usually did the dirty work
Clarence allowed himself to think up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, speaking of that fellow, wonder what&rsquo;s
become of him?&rdquo; George remarked; for there
was a standing rivalry between his boat and that
of the other, both being built solely for speed, and
not comfort or safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he hint something about coming up
in this region later on?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood it that way,&rdquo; observed Herb.
&ldquo;And more than a few times, while we cruised
along the southern shore of Ontario and Erie, I
thought we&rsquo;d see his pirate boat bob up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t run across that crowd again,&rdquo;
observed Nick. &ldquo;For they&rsquo;re sore on us, and
bound to do us a bad turn if they find the
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we can keep our eyes open,&rdquo; remonstrated
George. &ldquo;You know Clarence believes
that <i>Flash</i> can make circles around my bully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
boat, and I&rsquo;m wanting to give him a chance to
prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chuck that, George,&rdquo; said Josh. &ldquo;You know
you beat him out once handsomely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he said he hadn&rsquo;t tried to do his
level best. Anyhow, if the chance comes again
I&rsquo;m ready to race him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long would we be gettin&rsquo; up till the Soo
now, Jack, darlint?&rdquo; asked Jimmie; who being
second &ldquo;high notch&rdquo; in the line of eaters in the
crowd, had been too busy up to now to do any
great amount of talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends pretty much on the weather,&rdquo;
replied the leader of the expedition, who studied
his charts faithfully, and was always ready to
give what information he picked up, to his
chums. &ldquo;We are now something like one hundred
and fifty miles sou&rsquo;-east-by-south from
Mackinac Island, where we expect to stop over
a few days. If we pick out a good morning we
ought to navigate the head of Huron and the
crooked St. Mary&rsquo;s river to the Soo in one day.
The steamers do, and we can make about as
fast time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we have to hold up for the <i>Comfort</i>
pretty much all the way,&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;not
that I&rsquo;m complaining, fellows, for I understand
that it takes all sorts of people to make a world,
and lots of different kinds of boats to please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
everybody. And in bad weather Herb and Josh
fare better than the rest of us. Well, suppose
we leave here tomorrow morning, if the weather
lets us, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try and make Mackinac with just
one more stop,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;That will be
easy enough; though if the wind gets around and
the waves increase, we&rsquo;ll have to run for some
snug harbor, George, because your boat and
mine are hardly storm craft on these big lakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a foine trip so far, I say,&rdquo; observed
Jimmie, reaching for another baked potato,
which Josh had cooked to a turn in the ashes of
the fire, somehow keeping them from blackening,
as is usually the case in camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Jimmie,&rdquo; replied Herb.
&ldquo;And with no serious accidents to come, we&rsquo;ll
make a record to be proud of. Just imagine us
sitting around the fire in our cozy club house that
is right now building, while Jack reads the stirring
log of our experiences up here. It will make
us live over the whole trip again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in George, &ldquo;and think of the
<i>bliss</i> that must bring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick colored a little, as he felt every eye on
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the moon just peeping up over yonder,
fellows,&rdquo; he observed, meaning to distract
their attention.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just about full too,&rdquo; remarked Jack. &ldquo;Going
to be a great night for a camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes me think of that moonlight race we
had with the <i>Flash</i>,&rdquo; George went on, his heart
always set on the matter of speed and victories.</p>

<p>Night was just closing in, and the grand full
moon was rising from the watery depths, so it
seemed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There comes a motor boat down yonder,&rdquo;
remarked Herb. &ldquo;See what a fine searchlight
she has. No need of that, though, as soon as the
moon gets fairly up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, she&rsquo;s just humping along to beat the
band, I tell you!&rdquo; declared Josh, as all eyes were
turned to where the shadowy form of the advancing
craft could be seen, growing plainer with
every passing second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; instantly remarked
George, who was unable to see much good in any
small craft when his pet <i>Wireless</i> was around.
&ldquo;I should say she was doing just fairly, you know;
but then she doesn&rsquo;t have to hold back for any
elephant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mean hit, George,&rdquo; said Herb,
though he never changed his mind about his
comfortable boat because of any slurs cast by
his mates, who might come to envy him in bad
weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at her cut through the water, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
you?&rdquo; Josh went on. &ldquo;The fellows aboard
don&rsquo;t intend to turn in here to stop over. Must
be in a hurry to get somewhere, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, she&rsquo;s just passing the rising moon.
Why, I declare, fellows, seems to me she looks
kind of familiar like!&rdquo; Nick exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jack jumped up, and secured a pair of marine
glasses. They were guaranteed for night work,
and through them he could see the passing motor
boat splendidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it, Jack?&rdquo; asked George, eagerly; and the
other nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same old <i>Flash</i>, all right,&rdquo; he
said, looking around the circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exploded Nick, &ldquo;Crafty Clarence is
on the trail once more, bent on revenge for the
beat George gave his pirate motor boat. I see
warm times looming up ahead of us, shipmates
all. And ain&rsquo;t I glad I know how to swim
now!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>CAUGHT BY THE STORM</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they know we are camping in
this place right now?&rdquo; Josh ventured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chances are, they do,&rdquo; replied Jack.
&ldquo;Both of those chaps possess eyes as sharp as
they make them. And there&rsquo;s another reason
why I think that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hear it, old fellow,&rdquo; begged Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a nice, attractive place to haul in, and
spend the night, when cruising along in a small
motor boat. As evening has come, not one in
ten would think of passing the cove by; and you
know it, boys,&rdquo; Jack went on, with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they deliberately did that same thing,&rdquo;
ventured Herb. &ldquo;Yes, I get on to what you
mean, Jack. They&rsquo;d rather boom along, and
take chances of being caught out on the open
lake in the night, even with a storm in prospect,
to stopping over near the camp of the motor boat
club. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I meant, Herb,&rdquo; nodded the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I guess you struck it, all right,&rdquo; commented
Josh.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But if they didn&rsquo;t want to say us agin, what
in the dickens did they iver kim up this way for,
I doan&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; remarked Jimmie, helplessly.</p>

<p>At that George laughed out loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Jimmie!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
asleep, you know. Why, don&rsquo;t you understand
that Clarence Macklin never yet took a beat like
a fair and square man? He won&rsquo;t rest easy till
he&rsquo;s tried it again with the <i>Wireless</i>. I happen
to know that he hurried his poor old boat to a
builder, and had him work on the engine, hoping
to stir it up a peg or two. And now he&rsquo;s going
to sneak around till he gets the chance to challenge
me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; went on Nick, following up the idea,
&ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t want to drop in here with us, because
in the first place he hates us like fun; and then he
was afraid George might ask questions about
his bally old boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to spring a surprise!&rdquo; declared
Josh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his play all the time. When we
had snowball battles, Clarence was forever hiding
with a bunch of his men, and jumping out
suddenly at us. That&rsquo;s where he got his name
of Sneaky Clarence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Jack, &ldquo;I hope George gets
a chance to show him up again for the fraud that
he is; but at the same time I don&rsquo;t want Clarence
and Bully Joe bothering us right along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
We didn&rsquo;t come up here just to chase around
after them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or have the gossoons chasing around afther
us, by the same token,&rdquo; laughed the Irish lad.</p>

<p>They sat around the fire, and carried on in
their usual jolly way, telling stories, laughing,
and singing many of the dear old school songs.
Six voices, and some of them wonderfully good
ones too, made a volume of sound that must
have carried far across the bay to the cottages,
where the summer residents were doubtless sitting
out in the beautiful moonlight.</p>

<p>The boys began to think of retiring about ten
or after. A couple of tents had been purchased
after coming to the St. Lawrence river country;
for somehow all of them became tired of sleeping
aboard the boats, since there was little of comfort
about it.</p>

<p>These tents had been erected under the supervision
of Jack, who knew all about how a camp
should be constructed, so that in case of wind or
rain no damage was likely to result.</p>

<p>They made a pretty sight now, with the moonlight
falling upon them, and the flickering fire
adding to the picture.</p>

<p>Jack had wandered down to the edge of the
water. The three motor boats were all anchored
close by, and everything had been made snug;
but of course it was not the intention of the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to leave things unguarded. The chances of
trouble were too positive to think of such foolishness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad, Jack, that the wind has gone down,&rdquo;
said a voice at his elbow; and turning Jack saw
the grinning countenance of George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; remarked the other,
slowly and cautiously, as if wondering whether
George could read his secret thoughts, and know
that he was just then thinking of the pretty
little girl whose hat he had rescued from the
hungry maw of the lake that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I think I hear voices over yonder where
they landed, and girls at that,&rdquo; George continued,
wickedly. &ldquo;No doubt the little darlings
are about embarking on the return trip to the
<i>Mermaid</i>. Now, if the wind would only suddenly
swoop along, perhaps a boat might be
upset. But Jack, with your clothes on, you&rsquo;d
have a tough time swimming out there and saving
Rita&rsquo;s life, like you did her bonnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! let up on that, will you?&rdquo; laughed Jack,
good naturedly; for he was used to such joking
and joshing on the part of his mates, and ready
to take it in the same spirit of fun that it was
meant. &ldquo;I was thinking about our boats here.
Seems to me that whoever is on guard should
take up a position where he can keep an eye on
the whole outfit. At the first sign of danger he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
must wake up the bunch of us. Isn&rsquo;t that right,
George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it is; but see here, you don&rsquo;t really think
anything <i>will</i> happen, do you?&rdquo; the other demanded,
uneasily. &ldquo;Because if I had any idea that
way, I&rsquo;d feel like going aboard, and sleeping
there, uncomfortable as a narrow speed boat is.
Why, it&rsquo;d nearly break my heart if anything
knocked my <i>Wireless</i> just now, and spoiled the
rest of my vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I guess there&rsquo;s no real danger,&rdquo; said
Jack, quickly; &ldquo;but you know my way of being
cautious. An ounce of prevention, they say,
George, is better than a pound of cure. We
insure our boats against explosion and loss; why
not do the same about our chances for a jolly
good time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Jack. That&rsquo;s a long head you
carry on your shoulders,&rdquo; admitted the skipper
of the speed craft. &ldquo;But there they come. I
can see the boat, and the white dresses of the
girls. She is a little angel, Jack, and seriously
I don&rsquo;t blame you for wanting to see more of
Miss Rita Andrews; but the chances are against
you, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, girls were the last thing we had in
mind when we started on this trip,&rdquo; remarked
Jack. &ldquo;We left lots of pretty ones at home, you
know; and we&rsquo;re getting letters from some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
them right along. There, they&rsquo;ve made the big
power boat all right, and are getting aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can go to sleep with an easy mind,&rdquo;
laughed George, &ldquo;because the young lady wasn&rsquo;t
wrecked in port. But perhaps we might happen
to catch up with &rsquo;em at the Soo, Jack. No
doubt you had thought of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We expect to be at Mackinac first, and people
generally stop off there a day or two,&rdquo; remarked
the pilot of the <i>Tramp</i>, falling into the
little trap shrewd lawyer George had set for him;
whereat the other gave him a dig in the ribs, and
ran off to the camp to get his blankets ready for
his first nap.</p>

<p>But nothing out of the way did happen that
night, though the motor boat boys kept faithful
watch and ward, one of them being on duty an
hour or more at a time up to dawn.</p>

<p>With the coming of the sun over the water all
were awake, and preparations for breakfast underway.
Jack, Nick and Josh concluded to take
a morning dip, while the rest were looking after
the cooking of a heap of delicious flapjacks done
to a brown turn as only the wonderful Josh could
coax them.</p>

<p>Smoke rising slowly from the big power boat&rsquo;s
cook&rsquo;s galley pipe announced that preparations
were underway there for an early start.</p>

<p>Indeed, the vessel started to leave the harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
even while Jack and his mates were still sitting
around the fire, disposing of the appetizing mess
that had been so skillfully prepared for the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; laughed George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Nick, innocently, with a sigh
of relief, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re heading north, sure as anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! we forgot there was a pair of &rsquo;em, sighing
like furnaces,&rdquo; jeered Josh.</p>

<p>But Jack and the fat boy only laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rank jealousy, Nick; don&rsquo;t you bother your
head about such cruel remarks,&rdquo; said the former,
winking to the stout youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, everybody get busy now,&rdquo; said George,
jumping to his feet. &ldquo;It looks like we might
have a fairly decent day, if that blessed old wind
keeps away. My boat rolls like fun when in a
wash, and I don&rsquo;t like it a bit. Hope we&rsquo;ll have
the air out of the southwest today, so we&rsquo;ll be
shielded by the shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried off to get aboard. The others were
not far behind, for tents had been taken down,
and blankets stowed, while breakfast was being
cooked; so that there was not a great deal to do
now.</p>

<p>Then, after a last survey of the late camp had
been taken by cautious Jack, in order to make
sure that nothing was forgotten and the fire dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he too stepped into his little dinky, paddled out
to where Jimmie awaited him aboard the <i>Tramp</i>;
and five minutes later the little flotilla started,
amid a tremendous popping of motors, and much
calling back and forth on the part of skippers and
crews.</p>

<p>Once outside the protecting cape they headed
due nor&rsquo;-east by north, and kept just a certain
distance away from the shore.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning, and gave promise of a
fine day; but these cruisers had learned through
bitter experience never to wholly trust such
signs. In summer at any rate, storms can develop
with suddenness on the big lakes, and a
squall start to blowing without warning. Hence
they had adopted as a motto, the slogan of the
Boy Scouts: &ldquo;Be Prepared!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George called out to the skipper of the <i>Tramp</i>,
and pointed ahead, where, several miles to the
north could be seen the dim shape of the big
power boat, rapidly covering the distance that
intervened between the cove and charming
Mackinac Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be at Mackinac tonight, all right,
Jack!&rdquo; shouted George, who led the little procession
in his speed boat.</p>

<p>Jack made no attempt at a reply; but Jimmie
took up the cudgels at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we&rsquo;ll make it by tomorry night, if all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
goes well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and begorra, not wan of
our boats is in the same class wid the big wan.
Take the three togither and they&rsquo;d be only a bite
for the <i>Mermaid</i>. So we bate thim aisy now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they chugged along as time passed. In an
hour all signs of the larger craft had passed from
their sight. At noon they opened up Thunder
Bay; and thinking to make the dangerous crossing
of its broad mouth before having lunch, they
kept on.</p>

<p>It was rather rough traveling, especially for
the narrow <i>Wireless</i>; and acting upon Jack&rsquo;s
suggestion George hovered close to the others,
so as to have help in case of trouble, and be
partly sheltered from the rollers by keeping in
their lee.</p>

<p>But the passage was made in safety; and after
that their course changed to some extent. The
shore turned more toward the northwest, so that
they headed into the wind, which was creating
some sea, in which the small craft wallowed considerably.</p>

<p>An hour later Jack began to cast anxious
glances toward the shore, hoping to discover an
opening of some sort, in which the fleet might
take refuge. For the sky was darkening by
degrees, and he fancied he caught the muttering
of thunder in the distance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>On their starboard quarter nothing could be
seen but a vast heaving expanse of water; for
Lake Huron at this point stretches more than
fifty miles, before Grand Manitoulin Island is
reached to the northeast.</p>

<p>It would be a bad place for such small craft
to be caught in a storm. Still, the shore looked
strangely devoid of any indentation, and Jack&rsquo;s
fears increased as the minutes passed without
any change for the better cropping up. But he
did not express these aloud, and even his boatmate
Jimmie, although often casting a look of
anxious inquiry at the face of his skipper, could
not tell what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>And then, without any warning, there suddenly
came a vivid flash of lightning over in the
west, almost immediately followed by an ominous
clap of thunder that seemed to make the
very air quiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that looks bad!&rdquo; called out Josh; who
was in the cranky speed boat, and had more
reason to be alarmed than most of his comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do, Jack?&rdquo; asked Herb, whose
<i>Comfort</i> was keeping close on the port side of the
boat Jack had charge of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Push on for all we&rsquo;re worth,&rdquo; answered the
other. &ldquo;I think I see a harbor, if only we can
make it before the storm breaks. George, you
leave us, and drive ahead; for the danger is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
greater with you than the rest. But don&rsquo;t worry
fellows; it&rsquo;s all right, we&rsquo;ve just got to make that
bay where the point sticks out, and we&rsquo;re going
to do it too.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>A STRANGE SOUND</h3>


<p>George recognized the wisdom of such a move
as his chum suggested. If the wind kept on increasing
as it seemed bound to do, and the storm
broke upon them in all its mid-summer violence,
the cranky speed boat would be apt to feel the
effect more than either of the other craft.</p>

<p>It was therefore of great importance that he
and Josh seek the promised shelter with all haste.
Much as he disliked leaving the balance of the
fleet, necessity seemed to compel such a move.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he threw on all the motive power
his engine was capable of developing, and began
to leave the others quickly in the lurch.</p>

<p>Jack could easily have gone ahead of the heavy
<i>Comfort</i>, but he did not mean to do so. Better
that they stick together, so as to be able to render
assistance if it were badly needed.</p>

<p>Talking across the narrow abyss of water separating
the two boats was altogether out of the
question, unless one shouted. There was no
time for an exchange of opinions, since all of
them needed to keep their wits on the alert, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
order to meet the dangers that impended.</p>

<p>Already had the waves grown in size. They
were getting heavier with every passing minute;
and the little motor boats began to actually wallow,
unless headed directly into the washing seas.</p>

<p>It was a critical time for all concerned, and
Nick could be seen with his cork life-preserver
carefully fastened about his stout body under the
arms, as if prepared for the very worst that could
happen.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Jimmie gave a
shrill whoop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They done it!&rdquo; he yelled, regardless of the
rules of grammar, such was his delight. &ldquo;The
ould <i>Wireless</i> is safe beyant the p&rsquo;int!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack saw that what he said seemed to be so.
The speed boat had evidently managed to reach
a spot where the jutting tongue of land helped
to shield her from the oncoming waves. She
no longer plunged up and down like a cork on the
water, though continuing her onward progress.</p>

<p>The sight spurred the others on to renewed
zeal. If George could do it, then the same measure
of success should come their way.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Jack noticed that there was
an apparent abatement of the wild fury with
which the heaving billows were beating against
the bow of his little craft. A look ahead told
him the comforting news that already was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
extreme point standing between the two boats
and the sweep of the seas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do be safe!&rdquo; shouted Jimmie; who, in his
excitable way seemed ready to try and dance a
jig then and there, an operation that would have
been attended with considerable danger to the
safety of the <i>Tramp&rsquo;s</i> human cargo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not a minute too soon!&rdquo; said Jack, as a
sudden gust of wind tore past, that might have
been fatal to his boat had it been wallowing in
one of those seas just then.</p>

<p>As it was, they had about all they could do to
push on against the fierce gale, protected as they
were by the cape of land. The spray was flying
furiously over that point, as the waves dashed
against its further side. But the boys knew
they were safe from harm, and could stand a
wetting with some degree of patience.</p>

<p>George was waiting for them, his anchor down,
at a point he considered the best they could make
for the present. He had managed to pull on his
oilskins, and was looking just like a seasoned old
tar as the other boats drew in.</p>

<p>Jimmie and Nick were ready with the mudhooks,
under the directions of their respective
skippers. Hardly had these found a temporary
resting-place at the bottom, than all four lads
seized upon their rainproof suits, and presently
they were as well provided against the downpour
as George.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>And the rain certainly did descend in a deluge
for a short time. They had all they could do to
prevent the boats from being half swamped, such
was the tremendous violence with which the
torrent was hurled against them by the howling
wind.</p>

<p>But after all, it was only a summer squall. In
less than half an hour the sun peeped out, as if
smiling over the deluge of tears. The wind had
gone down before, but of course the waves were
still rolling very heavily outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles our going on today!&rdquo; declared
George, as he pointed at the outer terminus of
the cape, past which they could see the rollers
chasing one another, as if in a great game of tag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty late in the afternoon anyhow,&rdquo;
declared Josh, who was secretly worried for fear
lest his rather reckless skipper might want to
put forth again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we might look a long way ahead
without finding a chance to drop into a harbor
as good as this,&rdquo; remarked Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; laughed Jack; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;d
be sillies to even dream of leaving this bully nook
now. Besides, if tomorrow is decent, we can
make an extra early start in the morning, and
get to Mackinac before dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suits me all right,&rdquo; Nick observed, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he complacently started to remove his oilskins,
so that he could pay attention to the bulky cork
life preserver, which he did not mean to wear all
night.</p>

<p>They found that it was possible to make a
point much closer to the shore, and it was decided
to do so, especially after sharp-eyed Jimmie
had discovered signs of a farm near by, possibly
belonging to a grower of apples, since a vast
orchard seemed to cover many acres.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that big power boat wasn&rsquo;t caught in
that stiff blow,&rdquo; Jack remarked, as they were
getting ready to go ashore in order to stretch
their legs a bit and look around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I guess they must have made Mackinac,&rdquo;
said George. &ldquo;She was a hurry-boat, all
right, and the wind would not bother her like it
did our small fry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, George, for that comforting remark.
I was really getting worried myself
about the <i>Mermaid</i>,&rdquo; observed Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to Buster, would you, fellows?&rdquo; cried
Josh. &ldquo;I never thought he&rsquo;d go back on the
girls we left behind us, and particularly Rosie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nick only grinned as they joined in the
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a privileged character now,&rdquo; he asserted,
stoutly. &ldquo;A sailor is said to have a best girl in
every port, you know, fellows. And every one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
you will agree with me that Sallie Bliss is as
pretty as a peach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just your size too, Buster,&rdquo; declared
Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for an engagement with some dime
museum company as the fat&rdquo;&mdash;started Josh;
when he had to dodge something thrown at him
by the object of this persecution, and the sentence
was never completed.</p>

<p>The ground being sandy close to the water,
they concluded to start a fire, so as to cook supper
ashore, since it was so much more &ldquo;homey&rdquo;
as Nick said, for them to be together at mealtimes.
But all were of the opinion that it would
be advisable to sleep on board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another hot squall might spring up during
the night,&rdquo; observed George, &ldquo;and just fancy
our tents going sailing off to sea. Of course I
don&rsquo;t hanker about putting in a night in such
cramped quarters as my narrow boat affords;
but it can&rsquo;t come anywhere near what I went
through with when Buster was my shipmate,
down on the Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then somebody ought to go after milk
and eggs,&rdquo; suggested Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, don&rsquo;t everybody look at me,&rdquo; Nick
bridled up. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the turn of another
bunch this time. Josh and myself have served
our country as haulers of the necessities.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But every farmer doesn&rsquo;t own a bull, Buster,&rdquo;
remarked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I object to bulldogs just as much.
Little fellows are all right, likewise pussy cats;
but deliver me from the kind that hold on to all
they grab. Nixey. You and Jack try it this
time, George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only fair,&rdquo; spoke up the latter, immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re going, the
sooner we start the better; because you see
the old sun is hanging right over the horizon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m nearly caved in for want of proper
nourishment,&rdquo; grumbled Nick.</p>

<p>No one paid any particular attention to his
remark; because that condition was a regular
part of his lamentations several times a day.
The only time Nick seemed to be in a state of
absolute contentment was the half hour following
a gorging bee; and then he beamed satisfaction.</p>

<p>Accordingly the pair started forth, armed with
a tin bucket for the milk. George had no great
love for biting dogs himself, and as they approached
the vicinity of the farm buildings he
suggested to his companion that they arm themselves
with stout canes, with which they might
defend themselves in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a prosperous place, all right,&rdquo;
Jack observed as they saw the buildings and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
neat appearance of things in general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But seems to me it&rsquo;s awful lonely here,&rdquo; remarked
George. &ldquo;Where can the people all be?
Don&rsquo;t see any children about, or women folks.
Plenty of cows and chickens, but sure they can&rsquo;t
take care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run
across somebody soon. Let&rsquo;s head for the barn
first. Generally at this time you&rsquo;ll find the men
busy there, taking care of the horses, and the
pigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear hogs grunting,&rdquo; remarked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I got the same sound myself; but do
you know it struck me more like a groan!&rdquo; Jack
said, in a voice somewhat awed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A groan! Gee; what do you mean, Jack?&rdquo;
exclaimed the other, turning toward his chum
with a white face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I said,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;And
listen, there it is again. Now I know it was no
swine you heard, George. That sound was from
the barn. Come on. I&rsquo;m afraid somebody&rsquo;s in
trouble here!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;CARRY THE NEWS TO ANDY!&rdquo;</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Nobody here, Jack!&rdquo; announced George, in a
relieved tone, as the two entered the stable, and
looked around.</p>

<p>A number of horses stood in stalls, munching
their oats, which in itself told the observing Jack
that some one must have been there a short
time before, since the animals had been recently
fed.</p>

<p>Before he could make any reply to his companion&rsquo;s
remark, once more that thrilling sound
came to their ears. And this time even George
realized that it was unmistakably a human groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came from over here!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, as
without the slightest hesitation he sprang across
the floor of the place.</p>

<p>George following close upon his heels, saw him
bending over the figure of a man, who was lying
upon the floor in a doubled-up position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened? Did one of the horses
kick him?&rdquo; gasped George, always a bundle of
nerves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
find no sign of an injury about him. It&rsquo;s more
likely a fit of some kind he&rsquo;s just recovering from.
Lots of people are subject to such things, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s just what;&rdquo; declared George. &ldquo;I
had an uncle who used to drop like a rock right
in the street or anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they do with him at such times?&rdquo;
demanded Jack, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, nobody seemed able to do much,&rdquo; replied
the other. &ldquo;I saw my father loosen the
collar of his shirt, and lay him out on his back.
A little water on his face might help; but in most
fits it takes some time to recover. But I thought
I saw his eyelids twitch right then, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s going to come out of it,&rdquo; replied
Jack, as he managed to get the old man into
what seemed like a more comfortable position.</p>

<p>And presently, as the two boys still bent anxiously
over him, the man opened his eyes. He
stared at them for a bit, as if trying to collect his
thoughts. Then a horse neighed, and he seemed
to realize his position.</p>

<p>Jack, seeing him trying to sit up, assisted him.
The old man sighed heavily, and spoke in a weak
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reckon I dropped in my own stable that time.
Might have been under the feet of the hosses too.
And both men away. Who are ye, boys? I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
beholdin&rsquo; to you more&rsquo;n I can say,&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>Whereupon Jack soon explained how they belonged
to a little company of cruisers who had
been driven by the storm to take shelter behind
the point of land; and that their present errand
was to secure a supply of fresh milk and eggs, if
so be they could be had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me to the house, please, boys,&rdquo; said the
farmer, trying to rise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always some weak
after one of these spells. They&rsquo;re acomin&rsquo;
oftener now, and I&rsquo;ll have to quit bein&rsquo; alone.
Now more&rsquo;n ever I need Andy. Oh! if they can
only find him for me, I&rsquo;ll be so happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this was so much Greek to the two
boys. But they gladly helped him to regain his
feet, and walk to the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men will be back soon, and you can have
all the milk and eggs you want!&rdquo; he declared;
and even as he spoke George discovered a team
coming toward the farmhouse, evidently from
some nearby town, with a couple of husky men
on the wagon, which was piled high with new
and empty apple barrels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That let&rsquo;s me out,&rdquo; laughed George, &ldquo;for
you see, I was just going to volunteer to milk
Bossie; and as I&rsquo;ve had mighty little experience
in that line, perhaps she&rsquo;d have kicked me into
the next county for a bungler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men came on to the house, seeing strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
present, and Jack soon explained the situation
to them. He learned that the old farmer&rsquo;s name
was Jonathan Fosdick, and that the Andy he
had spoken about was his only son, with whom
he had quarreled several years back, and for
whom his heart was forever yearning, now that
old age and disease began to grip hold of him.</p>

<p>Supplied with the milk and the eggs the two
lads started back to the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise to come up and see me again tonight,
boys,&rdquo; the old farmer had pleaded, as he came to
the door with them, after positively refusing to
accept any pay for what they had received. &ldquo;I
want to speak with you about something that&rsquo;s
on my mind a heap lately. You helped me
once; p&rsquo;raps ye can again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what under the sun do you think he
meant?&rdquo; remarked George, as they plodded
along with their heavy burdens toward the lake
shore, where the boats lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait, and we&rsquo;ll know all about it soon,&rdquo;
replied Jack; for while he could himself give a
pretty good guess what was on the mind of Mr.
Fosdick, he did not care to commit himself.</p>

<p>The others greeted the foragers with loud cries
of delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there wasn&rsquo;t any bull handy?&rdquo; said
Nick, with an evident shade of disappointment
in his voice; for Nick was nothing if not generous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and having tasted the delights of being chased up
a tree by an angry bovine, he felt that the other
fellows ought to share the experience with him.</p>

<p>The fire was already burning briskly, and Josh
employed in his customary tasks of getting
things ready for cooking. At such times Josh
was looked upon as a czar, and his simplest word
was law. It was very pleasant for the tall,
lanky lad to feel that he did have an hour or so
each day, when every one bent the knee to his
superior knowledge; and he certainly made the
most of it.</p>

<p>And the supper was of course a bountiful one.
It could not be otherwise so long as Nick and
Jimmie had a hand in its preparation. The former
hovered around from time to time, suggesting
that Josh add just another handful to the
rice that was being cooked, or possibly wondering
if they could make one big can of mullagatawny
soup do for six fellows; until frequently the boss
would turn and wither him with a look, backed
up as it was with that big spoon.</p>

<p>Later on, after everybody had declared themselves
satisfied, Jack beckoned to the skipper of
the <i>Wireless</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We promised that we&rsquo;d run up and see how
Mr. Fosdick was getting on, fellows,&rdquo; remarked
the latter. &ldquo;Be back inside of an hour or so;
long before you are thinking of going aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick started to rise, but sank back again as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This farmer keeps a black bull, Buster. I
saw him in an enclosure, and seemed to me the
bars looked mighty slender!&rdquo; observed George,
maliciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I think this fire feels mighty
comfy,&rdquo; grinned Nick.</p>

<p>The two boys found Mr. Fosdick waiting for
them. The woman who did his household work,
a black mammy, had been over at a neighbor&rsquo;s
when they were there before; but had later on
returned, and cooked supper.</p>

<p>Things even looked a little cheerful, with the
lamp-light flooding the comfortable livingroom
of the big farmhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, boys,&rdquo; said the farmer, pointing to
two chairs, he himself reclining on a lounge.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wondering now why I wanted to see ye
again. I&rsquo;m beholdin&rsquo; to you for the prompt
assistance you gave me. But there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
more&rsquo;n that. Did ye say as how ye was bound
for Lake Superior way soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we are going as far as the Soo,&rdquo; Jack
replied, readily; &ldquo;and we may take a notion to
prowl along the northern shore for a short distance.
I&rsquo;ve always heard a heap about the big
speckled trout to be taken around the mouth of
the Agawa river and other places there, and
since we have the chance I thought I&rsquo;d like to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to land a whopper, if so be the rest of the boys
are willing to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Agawa!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Fosdick, eagerly.
&ldquo;I wonder if that might be the place now. &rsquo;Twas
somewhere along that northern shore he said he
saw my Andy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was your son, I take it?&rdquo; ventured Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my only boy or child. His mother died
after he ran away, and I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; old now. I
want Andy to come home; but try as I would, I
never could get a line to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell about his boy, and for
a long time Jack and George had to listen to an
account of Andy&rsquo;s childhood life. Gradually he
came to the point where the highstrung boy had
refused to be treated as a child any longer. A
violent quarrel had followed, and Andy left
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now I was most to blame,&rdquo; said the
old man, contritely; &ldquo;and if only I could get
word to my boy I&rsquo;d beg him to come back to me.
I want to see him again before I foller his mother
across the great divide. Just a week ago I had
a letter from a party who told me he was sure
he saw Andy in a fish camp up on Superior.
He&rsquo;d growed up, and the gentleman didn&rsquo;t have
a chanct to speak with him; but afterward it
struck him who the man was. If so be ye run
across Andy, tell him I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; with my arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
stretched out for him, won&rsquo;t ye, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure we will!&rdquo; declared George, heartily,
for he was considerably affected by the appearance
of grief on the old man&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>They soon afterward started to say goodnight,
wishing to get back to where the rest of the party
sat around the camp fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell ye,&rdquo; went on Mr. Fosdick, as
he followed them to the door, &ldquo;as they was a
young chap here t&rsquo;other day as said he&rsquo;d keep
an eye out for Andy. And now that I think of
it, he had a little motor boat too, like them you
tell me about. And he said he &rsquo;spected to cruise
around Superior a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George and Jack exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was his name Clarence Macklin?&rdquo; asked
the latter, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what it was,&rdquo; replied the farmer, waving
them a farewell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you think of that?&rdquo; asked
George, as they strode on. &ldquo;Why, that fellow
is bound to crop up all the time like a jack-in-the-box.
We can&rsquo;t even start to do a poor heartbroken
old father a good turn, but he gets his
finger in the pie. But there&rsquo;s a bully chance for
me to get another race with his piratical <i>Flash</i>,
and that&rsquo;s some satisfaction;&rdquo; and Jack found
himself compelled to laugh, realizing that George
had his weakness just as well as Buster.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>TIED UP AT MACKINAC ISLAND</h3>


<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Nick who shouted this aloud on the following
morning. They had arisen at dawn, and
prepared a hasty breakfast. Josh had looked
out for this on the preceding evening, for he had
cooked a pot of grits, which being sliced while
cold was fried in butter after being dipped in egg.
Only several fryingpans were needed for the job,
on account of the extreme fondness Nick had for
that particular dish. But long ago his comrades
had learned to view such an assertion on the
part of the fat boy with suspicion; because it
was discovered that the present treat was <i>always</i>
the one Buster adored most.</p>

<p>The waves still seemed larger than might prove
comfortable, but there was a fair chance of their
going down later on in the day. Besides, George
was gaining more confidence in his narrow boat,
as he came to know it better; and he possessed
something of a reckless spirit in addition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this just glorious!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick,
when they had gotten fully started, and passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
beyond the protecting point, felt the full force
of the waves.</p>

<p>Not a voice was raised in dissent; even Josh,
while looking a little anxious, refused to put up a
complaint as the <i>Wireless</i> ducked and bowed
and slid along through the troubled waters like
a &ldquo;drunken duck,&rdquo; as Nick termed it aside to
Herb.</p>

<p>But just as they had anticipated, things improved
as the day advanced. The breeze grew
lighter; and while it came over many miles of
water, the sea was not threatening. Besides,
there is such a thing as growing accustomed to
such things. What in the beginning might excite
apprehension, after a while would be accepted
as the natural thing, and even looked
upon with indifference.</p>

<p>They kept this up until after the noon hour,
and splendid progress was made, so Jack declared.
As he had been elected the commodore
of the fleet, and kept tab of the charts, they always
depended on what he said as being positive.</p>

<p>Finding a good opportunity to get ashore
about this time the boys accepted it by a unanimous
vote. So many hours aboard small boats
gives one a cramp, and under such conditions a
chance to stretch is always acceptable.</p>

<p>Their stay was not long, for all of them were
anxious to reach the beautiful island known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Mackinac by evening. So once more the fleet
put out, and in a clump bucked into the northwest
breeze and the sea.</p>

<p>They were now heading due northwest, and
about three in the afternoon George declared
he could see land dead ahead which he believed
must be Bois Blanc Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon now you&rsquo;re just about right,&rdquo; said
Jack, after he had consulted his map, and then
in turn peeped through his marine glasses. &ldquo;For
the way we head, there couldn&rsquo;t be any other
land straight on. If that&rsquo;s so, fellows, we&rsquo;ll
raise the hilly island just beyond pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before four they could get a sight of what
seemed a little green gem set in the glittering
sea of water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mackinac, all right,&rdquo; observed George.
&ldquo;I can see white dots among the green, that
stand for the houses. We&rsquo;re going to get there
today, fellows. Told you so, Buster. Me for
a juicy steak tonight then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t mention it, please,&rdquo; gasped Nick.
&ldquo;You make my mouth fairly water. And if our
boss cook would only suggest fried onions along
with it, my cup of joy would be running over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; called out Josh, &ldquo;if you promise to
peel the tear-getters. We need such a heap to
satisfy that enormous appetite of yours, not to
mention some others I know, that I refuse to
undertake the job.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right; count on me!&rdquo; cried Nick, looking
around as though anxious to begin work at
once, a proceeding that George vetoed on the
spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need my eyes to see how to steer, thank
you, Buster,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You just hold in
your horses. Plenty of time. Besides, most of
the onions are aboard the <i>Comfort</i> along with
Josh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later they were approaching the magic
isle that has won a fame all its own as a picture
of beauty seldom equalled, and never excelled&mdash;green
with its grass and foliage, and with many
snow white cottages and hotels showing through
this dark background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like it?&rdquo; asked
Jack, as the three boats sped onward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied several of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ll soon be there!&rdquo; declared Nick;
but everybody knew without asking, that he
was thinking about that beefsteak and onions,
rather than the joy of reaching such a pretty
shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the old blockhouse up on the hill!&rdquo;
remarked Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been reading up on this place, and
history tells about some lively times around here
during the War of 1812. Seems the British
thought Mackinac a good place to have possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of. They sent out an expedition, and came
ashore in the night, surprising the little American
garrison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was tough,&rdquo; grunted Josh. &ldquo;Like to
hear things the other way. Thought Americans
never got taken by surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; laughed Jack; &ldquo;you want to read
history again, my boy. But I notice a good
many steamers around. I reckon most of those
bound through to Chicago stop here, as well as
the Lake Superior ones. There&rsquo;s a boat coming
in full of people. The <i>Islander</i> she&rsquo;s called.
That must be the boat going over to the Snow
Islands every day. There&rsquo;s another back of
her, perhaps coming down from the Soo. Seems
quite a lively place, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet it is. We must take a run around
the island tomorrow, before going on. Never
do to pass this by, as we may not be here again
in a hurry,&rdquo; Herb remarked.</p>

<p>Approaching the shore they began to look out
a suitable place where the small boats might be
tied up for the time they expected to remain.
This was not easy to find, since they had to take
care and not get in the way of any large craft
that might be going out.</p>

<p>After all it was Nick who discovered the opening.
Josh declared that the fat boy&rsquo;s vision was
sharpened by the clamorous demands of his appetite;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
but Nick, as usual, paid little attention to
such slurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going ashore to find a butcher shop?&rdquo;
he demanded, as they began to draw close in to
the shore, and get ready to tie up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appoint you a committee of one to secure
the steak,&rdquo; said Jack, solemnly; &ldquo;and remember,
don&rsquo;t let it be a bit over one inch thick, and weigh
more than five pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! that wouldn&rsquo;t be even a pound
apiece!&rdquo; expostulated Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! we expect to have some other things
along with it, remember,&rdquo; Jack continued.
&ldquo;You know the penalty of disobedience to orders,
Buster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deprived of food allowance for twenty-four
hours!&rdquo; broke in Josh.</p>

<p>Nick only groaned; and presently finding a
chance to creep ashore he hurried off on his delightful
errand. For when there was anything
connected with meals to be done, Nick was as
spry as anybody in camp.</p>

<p>It was some little time before he showed up
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! look at what&rsquo;s coming, would you?&rdquo;
shouted Josh, suddenly.</p>

<p>Of course it was Nick, laden with various
packages, and grinning amiably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Jack,&rdquo; he announced as he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
ambling along. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t weigh a fraction
over five pounds. Oh! I was mighty particular
about that, I tell you. Had him cut off pieces
of the tail till it got down to an even thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, somebody help him, or he&rsquo;ll take a
header into the brink, and lose half of what he&rsquo;s
hugging so tight!&rdquo; called Herb, and Jimmie
started to obey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s in all these other packages?&rdquo;
asked Jack, pretending to frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, onions, just onions and then more
onions!&rdquo; came the bland reply; at which the
others burst out into a roar, causing Nick to look
at them in pity. &ldquo;You fellows can laugh all
you please,&rdquo; he said in lofty scorn; &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t
feaze me one little bit. I was afraid we might
fall short, and so I bought a half peck at the
butcher&rsquo;s. Then, while I was coming along, I
saw some white ones, and couldn&rsquo;t resist the
temptation to get a couple of quarts. They
go fine raw when you feel just nippy, you see,
along with a piece of pilot bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s still another package; how about
that, Buster?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered the other, slowly; &ldquo;after I
started off with the white ones would you believe
it I discovered a lot of those fine big Spanish
onions in a confectioner&rsquo;s store. I just couldn&rsquo;t
resist the temptation to get half a dollar&rsquo;s worth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Mightn&rsquo;t have the chance again, you know, fellows.
It&rsquo;s my treat this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness! we&rsquo;ve really got enough of
something to satisfy Pudding for once!&rdquo; cried
Josh, as he received the various packages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the steak, Josh,&rdquo; said the provider,
proudly. &ldquo;Guess I ought to know a good thing
in that line. It&rsquo;s streaked with fat, and is bound
to just melt away in your mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh admitted that it did look tempting; and
later on the entire party agreed that Nick had
profited by his hobby.</p>

<p>When starting upon this extended trip the
motor boat boys had agreed that on no account
would they sleep under the roof of a house, unless
in case of sickness. So even at Mackinac they
must keep to their boats.</p>

<p>Several of them went ashore to see what the
place looked like under the electric lights, returning
an hour or so later, ready for bed. Those
left behind had attended to all necessary arrangements,
so that little time was lost.</p>

<p>As customary, the watches were made up of
two, on different boats, and so selected that Nick
would be paired with Jack himself; because the
commodore was suspicious of Buster&rsquo;s ability
to remain awake with any one else as his sentry
mate.</p>

<p>It happened that while these two were taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the first turn, and Jack every once in a while
would poke Buster with a setting pole he kept
handy, something not down on the bills came to
pass. The first thing that Jack knew about it
was when Nick gave vent to a shrill screech, and
scrambled to his knees, holding on to some
struggling object that seemed to scratch and
snarl and act in a way that was altogether mysterious.
And of course the whole six boys were
immediately awake, sitting up to ask all sorts of
questions.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>GEORGE WAITS FOR HIS CHUMS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Josh exclaimed, as he scrambled
to his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buster is on the rampage again! That&rsquo;s
what comes of eating too much supper. He&rsquo;s
got a bad case of indigestion, I bet!&rdquo; declared
George, grumblingly; for he had come very near
falling over the side of his boat when Josh made
that sudden move, and it startled him not a
little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s got hold of something, I tell you!
Look at him grabbing around. Must be a wildcat
or something like that,&rdquo; Josh went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith ye&rsquo;re all wrong,&rdquo; spoke up Jimmie.
&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s a monkey he&rsquo;s huggin&rsquo; till his breast,
so he be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A monkey!&rdquo; cried Herb, as he appeared behind
the fat boy, holding a fryingpan threateningly
in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; gasped Nick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see, a tame monkey, and with a little red cap,
and a coat on. He was going through my pockets,
I tell you, when I woke up&mdash;that is when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
first felt him. Give us a hand here and help me
hold the little scratcher. My! but he&rsquo;s strong,
and he tries to bite my nose every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re hurting him,&rdquo; said Herb.
&ldquo;Wait till I get hold of that bit of rope he&rsquo;s trailing
behind. Now let him loose, Buster, but
keep him away from your face. He&rsquo;d scratch
your eyes out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queer little visitor seemed to be willing
to submit, once Nick stopped squeezing him; for
he immediately took off his red cap, and made
quite a bow. Then he snatched up a small tin
cup that was attached to a belt he wore, with a
tiny chain, and held it out to Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him a penny, Herb,&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he recognizes an old acquaintance; help
a poor fellow in distress, Herb!&rdquo; Josh hastened to
add.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where under the sun d&rsquo;ye suppose he came
from?&rdquo; asked George, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must belong to some Italian organgrinder, I
should say, judging from the uniform, and the
piece of broken rope. Perhaps he&rsquo;s run away,
and wanted to become a stowaway on board
Herb&rsquo;s boat,&rdquo; Jack went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the other remarked, promptly,
&ldquo;anyhow, he knew a good boat when he saw one.
Give him credit for that. But did you hear what
Buster said about him feeling in his pockets?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Now, I&rsquo;ve heard it said that often these monkeys
are taught to steal, going up into second-story
windows, and grabbing things. Perhaps he was
sent aboard right now to pick up anything he
could find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you he knew all about vest pockets, as
sure as you live,&rdquo; announced Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as if he had got something in his
pocketbook right now!&rdquo; declared Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? A monkey have a pocketbook?
You&rsquo;re poking fun at us!&rdquo; cried Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, eh? You observe me,&rdquo; said Herb, as
with a dextrous movement he seized upon the
monkey, and by main strength forced him to
eject something from his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s a real watch, fellows!&rdquo; cried Nick,
astonished; &ldquo;he had it right in his cheek, sure
he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s my little dollar nickel watch,&rdquo; said
Herb. &ldquo;Shows he searched me before trying
Buster. All the same if it&rsquo;d been a hundred dollar
gold repeater. He&rsquo;s a thief, sure enough.
What&rsquo;ll we do with him, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie him up, and if nobody comes after him,
we&rsquo;ll keep Jocko,&rdquo; suggested Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;d be lots of fun, I suppose,&rdquo; grumbled
Nick. &ldquo;But if he stays it&rsquo;s got to be on another
boat than this. The little fiend would have
it in for me. He&rsquo;d worry the life out of me; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
I just can&rsquo;t afford to lose any flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed your tune, eh?&rdquo; taunted Josh.
&ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard you trying all sorts of
ways to get thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was before I took notice of the horrible
example we had along, of the living skeleton,&rdquo;
retorted Nick. &ldquo;After that I just made up my
mind to remain nice and plump. Some people
look best when they&rsquo;re fat, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, he&rsquo;s thinking of Sallie again,&rdquo; remarked
Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t seen a sign of the <i>Mermaid</i>,&rdquo;
remarked George; &ldquo;and I reckon she&rsquo;s left here
for the Soo region ahead of us. But Herb, find
some way to fasten the little rascal up for tonight,
so he can&rsquo;t do any mischief. If his owner
comes for him in the morning we&rsquo;ll give him a
scare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herb managed to do this, although Nick declared
he would be afraid to take a wink of sleep
for fear of being choked, or something else as
dreadful. All the same when his time came to
give up sentry duty, no one heard so much as a
&ldquo;peep&rdquo; from Nick again until daylight arrived.</p>

<p>It was arranged on the following morning that
they should explore the island, in order to see
its wonders and beauties, in two detachments,
each consisting of three. Jack learned that
bicycles could be hired close by, and mounted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
these he and Herb and Josh made the grand
rounds, allowing nothing to escape them.</p>

<p>Then after lunch the others took wheel and
carried out the same programme, even to visiting
the old blockhouse on the hill, and viewing the
charming marine spectacle from the top of the
little bluff.</p>

<p>As they gathered around late in the afternoon
to compare notes, and discuss the various matters
that interested them, Jack noted first of all
that the shrewd little monkey, which had been
dubbed Jocko, was still aboard the <i>Comfort</i>.</p>

<p>Nobody had shown up to inquire about him.
Nick was for going ashore and spreading the
news of the find far and wide; but the others refused
to allow him. They really believed that
Jocko had been sent aboard by his master to
steal; and that this party was afraid to claim him
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we have to take him along he&rsquo;ll give us lots
of fun,&rdquo; remarked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Buster is only thinking that there&rsquo;d be
one more mouth to feed, and that might cut his
share of the rations down a peg,&rdquo; asserted Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s where you wrong me,&rdquo; declared
the fat boy, solemnly. &ldquo;If you insist on hearing
what I was thinking about, I&rsquo;ll tell you. Suppose
we should get stormbound somewhere up on
the twisting St. Mary&rsquo;s river, or on the biggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fresh water lake in the world&mdash;why, you see we
could always turn to Jocko, and make a good
meal. I remember reading that monkeys were
just prime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you cannibal!&rdquo; cried the horrified Josh.
&ldquo;Why, that poor little innocent looks just like a
baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Nick, &ldquo;your mother showed
me your picture when you were six months old,
and there <i>is</i> a close resemblance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Night came on, and there was no claimant, so
Jocko ate supper with the boys. He was already
making good friends, and seemed very well satisfied
with his new lot. Perhaps he missed the
cuffing and beating he was accustomed to; but
he could do without that very well; and the eating
must have appealed to him strongly.</p>

<p>In the morning they left soon after breakfast.
The day opened fair, and they knew there was a
long trip before them if they hoped to cross the
head of Lake Huron, and follow the winding
channel of the St. Mary&rsquo;s river so as to reach
Sault Ste. Marie by night.</p>

<p>Fortunately the breeze, what little there was,
chanced to be in the north for a change. This
allowed them to keep close to the southern shore
of the peninsula for some hours, following its
contour and avoiding the pounding that heavy
seas always brought in their train.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally they entered the narrow strait between
the mainland and big Drummond Island.
Here the bustling port of Detour was passed.
Nick hinted about going ashore and doing a little
marketing; but Jack vetoed that proposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time to do all that after we get to
the Soo tonight,&rdquo; he observed; and Nick knew
there was no appeal from his decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that Canada over yonder?&rdquo; asked Josh,
pointing to the island off their lee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Drummond belongs to Michigan,&rdquo; Jack
replied. &ldquo;Further on though, we&rsquo;ll strike St.
Joseph&rsquo;s Island, and that is a part of Canada.
So we&rsquo;ll all step ashore just to say we&rsquo;ve been
outside the U. S. for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that Mud Lake you were telling us
about is somewhere along there, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Herb
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find it, I reckon,&rdquo; replied the commodore,
drily.</p>

<p>They did, and had reason to remember it too.
Sometimes the waterway bearing the outlet of
Lake Superior to the lower lakes was very wide
and imposing. Then again it would narrow
until Nick expressed his firm conviction that
they had taken the wrong channel, and would
be stopped, and have to return over their course.</p>

<p>But Jack kept his charts before him as he led,
and was positive he had made no mistake of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sort. Occasionally George would be unable to
restrain his impetuous nature. At such times
he would shoot ahead of the others, to make a
little rush of perhaps a mile, and then slow up to
await their coming, being always careful not to
lose sight of his chums.</p>

<p>But alas, George did this prank just once too
often. He heard Jack say some time before that
they were passing through Mud Lake, and must
be careful; but thought this referred to getting
lost in some side passage that looked promising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait up at the head yonder; you&rsquo;re too slow
for me!&rdquo; he called out, as the <i>Wireless</i> left the
bunch, and cut through the water like an arrow
shot from an archer&rsquo;s bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lookout!&rdquo; warned Jack; but George who was
quite confident concerning his own ability to
manage his affairs, just waved a hand back, and
continued to speed for all his racing boat was
worth.</p>

<p>Jack was sitting there where he could manage
the wheel and continue to study the chart
spread in front of him, when he heard a wild
whoop from Jimmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! look yander!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was just in time to see poor Josh take a
flying header into the water, when the speed
boat came to an abrupt stop on a concealed
mudbank.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of the tremendous splash floated
back to the ears of the others, causing Nick to
roll over, and make the boat quiver with his
riotous laughter; for that Josh should be the
victim of this ridiculous accident gave the fat
boy exceeding great joy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>IN TERRIBLE PERIL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack,
grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; demanded Herb; for at the
moment it happened that the <i>Tramp</i>, being in
front, obstructed the vision of those in the larger
boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! tell me, was that really poor old clumsy
Josh?&rdquo; demanded Nick, poking his red face over
the side of the <i>Comfort</i>. &ldquo;I saw a pair of legs
up in the air, and remembered some fellow down
at Mackinac telling us what big frogs they found
up here along the St. Mary&rsquo;s. The bass just
love them, he said, and the bigger the frog the
larger bass you get. That one would take in a
whale, I guess, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Josh all right, for I can see George trying
to get him with his boat hook right now,&rdquo;
said Jack, hardly knowing whether to laugh, or
feel provoked on account of the possible delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did Josh jump? Was he practicing
stunts?&rdquo; Nick went on innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the commodore, &ldquo;I imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
George made him squat up in the extreme bow,
to sing out if he saw a shallow place ahead. And
evidently Josh was looking all around, for he
failed to discover a mudbank that was just hidden
under the surface of the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But George found it,&rdquo; asserted Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust George for findin&rsquo; annything at all, at
all,&rdquo; grinned Jimmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope he didn&rsquo;t go to busting his old engine
again. My! what a terrible time we did have
with that cranky thing on the Mississippi,&rdquo; observed
Nick; who had been on board the speed
boat during that memorable cruise down to New
Orleans, and hence passed through an experience
he would never, never forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; echoed Jack. &ldquo;Perhaps the
worst is yet to come. Perhaps he ran on that
old mudbank so hard, going at top speed as he
was, that he won&rsquo;t find it an easy job to work off
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might delay us, be the powers, so we
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pull into the ould Soo short
of tomorry, bad cess till hasty George!&rdquo; remarked
Jimmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Nick, with a contented
sigh, &ldquo;at the worst we&rsquo;ve got Jocko, you remember,
boys. Baked or stewed he&rsquo;d make a meal
for the crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile they were rapidly drawing closer
to the stuck <i>Wireless</i>. Apparently the skipper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the stranded craft had succeeded in dragging
his crew out of the mire, for there was a dripping
figure on the forward deck, scraping the mud
away, and evidently more or less bubbling over
with various remarks.</p>

<p>Jack cautioned Herb to slow down as they
drew near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad enough to have one held fast,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If the whole bunch got stuck, why, we&rsquo;d have
to take to the dinkies, and go ashore on Canada
soil. How does your engine work, George?
Nothing broken I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; came the reply from George
who looked somewhat humiliated, as does every
sailor when held up on a mudbank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it a try, and see. Reverse, and perhaps
you&rsquo;ll glide off backwards, the same way you
went on,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>

<p>At any rate the engine worked apparently as
well as ever; but though George put it at its
&ldquo;best licks,&rdquo; as he declared, there was not a sign
of anything going.</p>

<p>Josh tried to use the setting pole, and came
very near taking another header.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, this mud goes right along down to
China, I reckon; leastways there ain&rsquo;t any bottom
to it!&rdquo; he cried, as he recovered himself just
in time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take your word for it, Josh,&rdquo; said
Nick, sweetly; &ldquo;because you know you&rsquo;ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
over to see for yourself. But I wouldn&rsquo;t try it
again. Next time perhaps you might stick your
head in and smother. Then what would I do
for any fun at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George kept trying every way he could think
of, in the effort to work his boat off the bank of
sticky mud. It was in vain. Apparently many
unseen hands held it tight, as though unwilling
to let the reckless skipper have another chance.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed, with several false
alarms, as George thought success was coming,
he turned to Jack with a blank face, upon which
disgust was plainly written.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get me out of this, commodore,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I own up that I don&rsquo;t seem
able to budge her a bit. Even with Josh in the
dinky, pulling like all get-out, and her engine
rattling away at full speed astern, she won&rsquo;t move
an inch. And already we&rsquo;ve lost enough time
to make it impossible to get to the Soo by night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George was apparently penitent, so Jack did
not have the heart to rub it in at that time.
Later on perhaps he might force the reckless one
to promise about turning over a new leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; we&rsquo;ll soon yank you out of that,
George. I didn&rsquo;t want to propose anything
until you had tried every scheme you could
think of. Herb, throw George your painter, and
let him make fast to the stern of the <i>Wireless</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Then I&rsquo;ll do the same by you. In that way we&rsquo;ll
be able to get both boats working. If George
starts his engine at the same time, she&rsquo;s just got
to come off, or go to pieces. Get what I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I do, and it&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; replied the
pilot of the <i>Comfort</i>, readily.</p>

<p>Of course George was willing enough to accept
any sort of assistance now. And he readily
made the painter fast to a ringbolt at the stern
of the speed boat.</p>

<p>When all things were ready, Jack asked him
to get his engine moving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, start yours up slowly, Herb,&rdquo; Jack went
on; &ldquo;not too fast to begin with; but gradually
increase until you&rsquo;re applying two-thirds of your
power. Stop there, and if she refuses to budge,
I&rsquo;ll come in. We&rsquo;ll get her yet. She&rsquo;s got to
come, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she did, after the <i>Tramp</i> added her drawing
facilities to those of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shrilled Josh, when the speed boat
started to move backwards out of her muddy
berth; he had almost plunged over again, and
saved himself by a quick clutch at a cleat near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; asked Herb, after they had become
disentangled again, and were in a condition
to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use thinking of making the Soo today,&rdquo;
remarked Jack. &ldquo;Too dangerous along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
upper reaches of this river to try it in the night.
We can move along to the upper end of this
island, and camp on Canadian land tonight, for
a change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me,&rdquo; observed Nick; but
only suspicious looks were cast in his direction;
for well they knew that the word &ldquo;camp&rdquo; with
Buster was another way of spelling &ldquo;eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far would we be from the city at the
rapids, then?&rdquo; asked Herb, as they once more
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we could make it in a few hours,&rdquo; Jack
replied, &ldquo;if all went well. Keep to the right of
that smaller island. That belongs to Michigan.
Some use the other channel; but we&rsquo;ll take this
one. You see, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Island is all of fifteen
miles long, and pretty wild in parts. Ought to
be good hunting here in season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish it was in season, then,&rdquo; said
Nick, smacking his lips. &ldquo;Always have wanted
to eat some venison from Canada right in camp.
Say, fellows, if a silly old deer just went and committed
suicide before our very eyes, by jumping
over a precipice, wouldn&rsquo;t we have a right to get
a haunch from his bally old carcase?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Jack, &ldquo;if a Canadian game
warden found you in possession he&rsquo;d take you
in. So just forget all you&rsquo;ve ever heard about
juicy venison. It&rsquo;s dry and tough stuff at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
best, and couldn&rsquo;t compare with that Mackinac
steak you bought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we have to wait till tomorrow noon before
we are in touch with a market, do we? I
don&rsquo;t ever see how we&rsquo;re going to pull through.
Tell you what, somebody ought to try for fish
here when we stop. Looks like bass might hang
around waiting for a chance to jump into the
pan. How about that, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I had made my mind to try,&rdquo;
smiled the other, who liked nothing better than
bringing his rod into play when there was a
chance for game fish.</p>

<p>After a while George announced that he could
see what looked like the end of the big island
ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a pretty decent place to pull in,&rdquo;
declared Herb.</p>

<p>As they had nothing to fear from storms or
hoboes in such a retired nook, the boys, having
secured their boats in proper fashion against the
shore, where they could not rub or get into
trouble, amused themselves as they saw fit.</p>

<p>Jack, true to his promise, got out his fishing
tackle, and proceeded to try all sorts of lures in
the hope of tempting a bass to bite. Finally he
took his little dinky, and began to troll, using a
phantom minnow. Almost immediately he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a vicious strike, and after a struggle pulled up a
fine fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it some more!&rdquo; called out Herb, who was
lying on the shore, watching him at the sport.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterward Jack duplicated his
feat, only this was even a larger fish than the
first. So the time passed. Josh was busily engaged
near the tents which he, Herb and George
had erected; while Jimmie was doing something
aboard the <i>Tramp</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nick?&rdquo; asked Herb, after a long time
had elapsed. &ldquo;I hope the silly fellow hasn&rsquo;t gone
and lost himself now. A fine time we&rsquo;d have
hunting that fat elephant through all that bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was here only a little while ago,&rdquo; remarked
George, looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looky yander, an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll see him!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jimmie; &ldquo;over beyant that dead three. Sure,
he do be sneakin&rsquo; up on something or other, and
thryin&rsquo; till coax it till kim till him. I say the
baste now. Oh! murdher! by all the powers,
somebody call out till him to sthop it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; asked
Josh, coming to life at the prospect of perhaps
seeing his rival for high honors in the farce line
duplicate his ridiculous feat of taking a header
into the mud and water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at him, would ye, the crazy wan!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
gasped Jimmie, &ldquo;thryin&rsquo; till coax a baste loike
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it Jocko?&rdquo; queried Josh, unable to catch
sight of the other just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little monk ye mane?&rdquo; replied Jimmie.
&ldquo;Och! that would be aisy now. It&rsquo;s tin times
worse than that. Call till him, Herb; I&rsquo;m that
wake I can hardly spake above a whisper. &rsquo;Tis
a terrible danger he be in, for the animal is a
white and black skunk; and poor innocent Nick,
I do belave he thinks it be a pretty pussycat!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>MAROONED</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Leave it alone, you Buster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get behind a tree, quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Buster, run for your life! It&rsquo;ll get
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George, Herb and Josh sent these warning
cries at the top of their voices. As to whether
the object of their combined concern heard, there
could be no reasonable doubt; for Nick immediately
waved one of his fat hands disdainfully toward
them. Evidently he imagined that his
chums were envious of his great good luck in
finding so splendid a chance to annex a beautifully
striped real Canadian pussy cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! murdher!&rdquo; ejaculated Jimmie, &ldquo;look at
the rickless fellow, would ye? Sure, he manes to
grab it, so he do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t, all the same!&rdquo; cried George,
grimly.</p>

<p>Since shouting and gesturing seemed to have
no effect upon the imperiled youth, all the four
boys could do was to stand there, holding their
breath, and watching the dreadful developments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Nor was that the first time or the last that they
found occasion to hold their breath.</p>

<p>Nick by now believed that he had wheedled
enough, and was within proper striking distance.
They saw him make a sudden forward swoop,
with extended arms, as if bent upon giving the
intended victim no possible chance of escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; yelled George, as he saw Nick stop
short, throw up his arms, and almost fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>One terrified look Buster gave the object of
his recent admiration. Then turning, he ran
as well as he could toward camp, gripping his
nose with both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare come near us, do you hear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve gone and done it, Buster!
That&rsquo;s what you get for wanting to bake poor
little Jocko!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George, as if in desperation, jumped over and
picked up his gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop where you are!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
willing to talk this thing over; but at a proper
distance, do you hear, Buster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Nick was aghast. Almost overpowered
by the terrible fumes as he was, it looked like
adding insult to injury when his own chums
turned against him, and refused to let him enter
the camp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He did come to a halt some thirty feet away,
and with one hand, clung to a sapling; while the
other was trying to keep the powerful scent from
smothering him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do, fellows?&rdquo; he asked, pitifully.</p>

<p>George was almost bursting with laughter,
but pretended to look as stern as his father when
serving in his capacity as judge of the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First promise that you won&rsquo;t attempt to
enter the camp without permission!&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise you, sure I do,&rdquo; groaned Nick
swaying weakly alongside his support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; went on George, &ldquo;you go and call
Jack in, if he isn&rsquo;t on the way here already, after
all this racket. We want everybody to have a
hand in deciding Buster&rsquo;s fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried the wretched Nick,
&ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye mean, George? Do I have to be
shot, because I made a little mistake? I give
you my word I really thought it was a Canada
species of cat. And if we had to have a menagerie
along with us, I was going to match her
against your monkey. Oh! why didn&rsquo;t I think?
I ought to have known better. It was awful,
fellows; shocking I tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Buster,&rdquo; remarked George,
putting his fingers up to his nose, &ldquo;please go a
little farther away. We can talk better then.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmie had hardly reached the shore before
he started back. And Jack was seen following
close behind. Evidently, then, the fisherman
must have heard the loud outcries, and speeded
his little boat for the landing, anxious to know
what could have happened to Nick.</p>

<p>He had no need to be told. One hardly required
to be within sixty feet of poor Buster to
understand the entire story. Jack did not laugh
though doubtless later on the incident would
afford him more or less merriment. It was a
serious matter, as he well knew, and must affect
every one in the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; called out Nick, looking beseechingly
at the commodore of the fleet, &ldquo;take my part,
won&rsquo;t you? They want to shoot me, or do something
as bad, just because I didn&rsquo;t know the gun
was loaded. Please take that thing away from
George. He looks so fierce I&rsquo;m afraid of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Jack, to ease the mind of the fat boy, who
was really shivering with anticipation of dire
results springing from his blunder, did take
George&rsquo;s gun from his unresisting hands, and laid
it aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Herb, &ldquo;something&rsquo;s
just got to be done. We can&rsquo;t bear to have him
in camp with us, you know, after this. And
think of me having to stand for that dreadful
smell day after day. Wow! it would knock me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
out. I&rsquo;d want to jump over in the deepest part
of Lake Superior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what can be done,&rdquo; said George,
&ldquo;except to maroon him here on this foreign island
until we come back again. By that time perhaps
it won&rsquo;t be so very bad. Herb can keep
him in the dinky towing behind, and stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that poor Nick set up a fresh howl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare think of doing that,&rdquo; he
cried, shaking his fat fist at the author of the
suggestion. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d starve to death in no
time; not to speak of being devoured by the wild
beasts. Think up some other way, won&rsquo;t you,
please, Jack? Don&rsquo;t listen to George. He&rsquo;s
got it in for me because I gave him so much
bother on that Mississippi cruise. I want you
to fix it up, Jack. You&rsquo;ll know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack still looked very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you understand that in a case of this
kind only desperate remedies will do, Buster?&rdquo;
he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know;&rdquo; whimpered the other, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m willing to do anything you say, Jack; but
don&rsquo;t leave me here over in a Canadian wilderness.
It ain&rsquo;t human, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jack proceeded, solemnly, &ldquo;if you
give me your solemn promise to obey. First of
all you must strip off every bit of clothes you
have on.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick began at once, and with eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it wash out, then? Oh! I can rub like
a good fellow, I promise you; only give me a
chance!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the washing in the world wouldn&rsquo;t take
that scent out,&rdquo; George declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way, and that is to bury the
clothes!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; gasped the astonished Nick; &ldquo;and
me go naked? Good gracious! Jack, I just can&rsquo;t
do that! Make it easier for me, won&rsquo;t you?
Why, I&rsquo;d get my death of cold. Besides, what
would I do when we got to the Soo? Please tell
me something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the boys could hold in no longer, and
a shout told that they were beginning to see the
comical side. But Jack waved his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;This is no laughing
matter. Never fear Buster, but you&rsquo;ll be
able to rake up enough clothes to last till we get
to the Soo, where you can buy a new outfit. Off
with every stitch, now. Then you must dig a
hole and bury them; or else carry the lot deep
into the bush here, as you choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Nick, tremulously, as he
hastily tore the last remnant of his garments
from his stout person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Get rid of the
stuff next. Then come back to where you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
now. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you with a pair of short
scissors I happen to have along with me; for you
see I&rsquo;ve just got to cut all your hair off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what a guy I&rsquo;ll be, Jack,&rdquo; moaned poor
Nick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure never hear the last of this thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of us!&rdquo; said George, sternly, &ldquo;how we
must remember it for days and days. You&rsquo;re
getting off dirt cheap, Buster, let me tell you.
I&rsquo;ve heard of fellows who had to live like hermits
in the woods for weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now get busy,&rdquo; observed Jack. &ldquo;The boys
will be rooting out your bag, and I&rsquo;ll fetch what
clothes we can gather to you. We must do all
we can to smother this perfumery factory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, be off wid ye!&rdquo; said Jimmie, bent on
having a hand in the game.</p>

<p>Nick stared mournfully at the clothes on the
ground. Then he slowly gathered them up in
his arms. They noticed that as he walked away
he looked around with exceeding care at every
step he took, as though not for worlds would he
want to renew his acquaintance with that pretty
striped Canadian pussy cat.</p>

<p>Jack was as good as his word. When George
and Herb had collected an outfit calculated to
serve poor Nick until they reached a land of
plenty, and clothing establishments, he carried
the lot to the place appointed.</p>

<p>Here came Nick presently with a most dejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
air; and groaning in spirit the fat boy allowed the
other to shear off all his abundant locks.</p>

<p>He certainly did look like a guy when the job
was completed, for Jack made no pretentions
towards being a barber, and there were places
that had the appearance of being &ldquo;chopped with
an axe,&rdquo; as George privately declared later,
when viewing the work of the commodore.</p>

<p>After that they made Nick take a long bath.
Indeed he thought he would never get out of the
water, and his teeth were chattering before the
embargo was finally raised.</p>

<p>Fortunately that wonderful red sweater which
had attracted the bull toward the wearer not so
very long since, had been safe aboard at the time
of his recent mishap, so that Nick could depend
on its warmth. He was grateful for small favors
just then; and quite subdued for a whole day;
though nothing could keep a buoyant nature
like his in subjection long.</p>

<p>Of course he would never hear the last of the
joke, and must stand for all manner of scoffing
remarks, as well as uplifted noses when he came
around. But Nick would live it down in time.</p>

<p>And no doubt, when the account of the cruise
was read over during the next winter, Nick would
join in the general laugh when he discovered that
Jack had called this temporary stopping place
on Canadian soil &ldquo;Kitty Kamp.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It was night before Nick was allowed to come
into camp; and even then they made him do
penance by sitting off in a corner by himself,
&ldquo;just like I was a leper,&rdquo; as he declared, though
bound to submit to the indignity.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows nobody good,&rdquo;
and at least Nick escaped guard duty that night,
for nobody wanted to sit up with him.</p>

<p>George declared that the very first thing he
meant to purchase when he arrived at the city
at the rapids was a bottle of violet water, with
which he could saturate himself for a season.</p>

<p>But by morning the terrible effect had in part
died away; though possibly familiarity bringing
about contempt may have had considerable to do
with their noticing the disagreeable scent less.</p>

<p>Of course all of them were glad to get away
from that camp. To Nick in particular its
memory would always evoke a shiver. When
brought to book in connection with the adventure
he always declared that it was what a fellow
got for wanting to invade foreign countries, and
meddle with unfamiliar animals belonging there.</p>

<p>But Jack and the others felt sure that Buster
from that day forth would know the great American
skunk a mile off, and shy at a closer acquaintance.</p>

<p>They got away at a reasonable time, and continued
their northern progress through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
crooked St. Mary&rsquo;s River. On the way they saw
numerous nooks that aroused the sportsman
spirit in Jack; for he just knew the gamy bass
lurked in those inviting waters, awaiting the
coming of the fisherman. But there was no
time to spend just then in seeking sport.</p>

<p>At about eleven o&rsquo;clock they passed the smaller
rapids, a most picturesque spot, where the water
rushed boiling through many channels, and innumerable
lurking places for the spotted trout
seemed to invite a stay. But the Soo was now
close at hand, and all of them were eager to look
upon the famous big rapids, unexcelled for beauty
and grandeur in all the land.</p>

<p>When the three motor boats presently reached
a point where the little city on the left hand shore
as well as the foamy rapids, and the railroad
bridge stretching from Canada to the Michigan
bank, came into view, the boys involuntarily
waved their hats, and sent forth a cheer.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3>DOWN THE SOO RAPIDS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Alabama! here we rest!&rdquo; cried George, as they
kept booming along up the strong current of the
river, until a spot was reached just below the foot
of the rapids.</p>

<p>Not many steamers stop at the Soo, save those
which run in connection with the tourist travel,
between Mackinac and the rapids city. But
there is a constant procession of steamers, and
whaleback grain barges going in both directions,
day and night, all during some seven months of
the year. The tonnage of the government canal
through which these boats pass around the
rapids far exceeds that of the Suez Canal for the
entire twelve months.</p>

<p>After finding a responsible party in whose
charge the three brave little boats could be left,
the cruisers proceeded to take in the sights.</p>

<p>Of course the rapids came first, and they viewed
these from every angle. Jack was also deeply
interested in the government fish hatchery on the
little island; and watched with an envious eye
the various pools in which scores of enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
speckled trout, weighing upward of seven pounds,
were kept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till we get to the Agawa,&rdquo; he said, shaking
his head with determination. &ldquo;I want to
find out how some of those whoppers feel at the
end of a line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick had made for a clothing emporium, where
he fitted himself out in some new clothes. Of
course he did not explain just why this was necessary;
but judging from the suspicious looks
cast upon him every time he came near the clerk,
the latter could give a shrewd guess concerning
the truth.</p>

<p>Jack was still watching some of those giant
trout jump out of the water in the pool when he
dangled a long blade of blue grass so as to make
the feathery end touch the surface like a fly,
when George joined him; for they had settled
upon the hatchery as a sort of rendezvous where
they could come together, so as to take the thrilling
ride down the rapids in a big Indian canoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All off, Jack!&rdquo; said George, trying to look
sober; though there was a merry twinkle in his
black eyes that belied the solemn cast of his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the other.
&ldquo;Anything more happened to that fellow Buster?
Or perhaps it&rsquo;s Josh who&rsquo;s bent on halting our
expedition now, with some caper. Go on, tell
me.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re away off,&rdquo; grinned George. &ldquo;I
only meant to inform you that they&rsquo;re gone on
ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean the <i>Mermaid</i>,&rdquo; Jack remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; George responded, promptly.
&ldquo;Left here this very morning for a cruise through
the Big Lake. Went through the canal about
breakfast time. Seems as if we&rsquo;re just bound to
keep tagging at their heels, don&rsquo;t it, Jack? I
suppose we&rsquo;ll hear a howl from Buster now, because
he is cheated out of seeing that fat Miss
Sallie again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buster has enough to think of in other directions,
I suspect,&rdquo; smiled Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should guess so,&rdquo; added the other.
&ldquo;Imagine, if you please, Nick trying to call on
any young lady at present. She&rsquo;d be apt to have
a swooning spell. For a time Buster will have
to cut out all thoughts of girls&rsquo; society. He can
thank his lucky stars that his chums allow him to
hang around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had any lunch?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s the rest of the bunch coming
along the stone walk by the canal, right now.
Perhaps we&rsquo;d better postpone our little ride down
the rapids until we get a bite. Buster will be
starved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is dogging the footsteps of the rest,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
remarked Jack. &ldquo;Herb is being cruel to the poor
old chap. He won&rsquo;t let him join them. I guess
he&rsquo;s suffered about enough by now, and we&rsquo;ll
have to let up on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; agreed impulsive George.
&ldquo;Anyhow, we wouldn&rsquo;t have the nerve to make
Buster take a canoe by himself, and shoot the
rapids. Let&rsquo;s start out and join them. Perhaps
Buster had discovered a good feed place, in his
wanderings about the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten to one he&rsquo;s noticed a dozen; and perhaps
had a few bites before now,&rdquo; and Jack led the
way across the little bridge connecting the island
where the hatchery was situated, with the
main shore.</p>

<p>Nick gladly admitted that he had marked a
promising restaurant during his foraging expedition
in search of the suit of clothes, which he
had taken to the boat and donned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a tony place, fellows,&rdquo; he argued;
&ldquo;but considering the circumstances, er&mdash;I
thought we wouldn&rsquo;t care for style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, not just at present, Buster;&rdquo;
George said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a level head for once.
We&rsquo;re going to forgive you now, and restore you
to good standing, on condition that you never,
never again try to stock the camp with a menagerie
of strange animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick promptly held up his right hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you my word, boys, and thank you.
Please overlook any slight association between
myself and our recent invasion of Canada. And
now come along. I tell you I feel as if I could
clean out all the restaurants in the Soo. I only
took a light breakfast you know, because of low
spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh held up both hands in despair, though he
said not a word. There are times when silence
is much more suggestive than any flow of language;
and every one understood.</p>

<p>An hour or so later, before half-past two, they
were on the little beach, talking with a couple of
wiry-looking men, who claimed to be sons of the
famous old guide of the rapids, John Boucher,
who died a few years ago, after having carried
thousands and thousands of summer tourists in
his canoe through those swirling rapids, without
ever a disaster.</p>

<p>Then the entire bunch of six boys took their
places in the big and staunch canoe, with a wielder
of the paddle at either end. Jack happened
to occupy a position near the man in the stern,
whose post is always the more important, since
he guides the destinies of the swiftly running
craft, while the one in the bow fends off from impending
rocks.</p>

<p>Jack had taken this position more to observe
how the experience affected his chums than for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
any other reason. He certainly never once
dreamed that there might be a Providence in such
a small thing as his choice of position.</p>

<p>Then began the first stage of the run, with the
two Indians pushing the laden craft upstream by
means of stout poles. They kept close to the
shore, finding a way around the numerous rocks,
and other obstacles, where the water boiled
madly; and by slow degrees approached the railway
bridge, under which the start is generally
made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this simply glorious?&rdquo; demanded Herb,
as they found themselves surrounded by the
churning waters, and gradually leaving the shore
farther away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;if you think this is fine,
what will you have to say when we get to running
the rapids in fact? I&rsquo;ve been through some
smaller than these, and can guess how it feels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! I&rsquo;d like to keep doing it all day!&rdquo; remarked
Nick, feeling something like himself again,
since he had been restored to favor once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, at the rate of fifty per, your bank
account would soon collapse. Besides, they say
that the excitement is bad on fat people, so that
they lose weight right along,&rdquo; George observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joshing me, I know, George,&rdquo; declared
the other. &ldquo;If I believed you, I&rsquo;d be
tempted to stay over here while you fellows went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
on, and keep going all day, so I could cut off, say
about thirty pounds or so. No, I wouldn&rsquo;t
either; I forgot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should think you did forget Sallie,&rdquo;
jeered Herb. &ldquo;If you got out of her class she&rsquo;d
never forgive you, Buster. Besides, perhaps
she wouldn&rsquo;t even <i>see</i> you if you wasted away to
a shadow. Better leave well enough alone, and
enjoy the good things of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we go now; they&rsquo;re heading straight out
on to the river!&rdquo; cried Josh, as he nervously
clutched the side of the big canoe near him; for
they were seated two and two, with Jack just
behind and George in front, as the boat narrowed.</p>

<p>The Indian guides were indeed pushing strenuously
now, and when the water deepened both of
them dropped their poles in the bottom of the
canoe, to seize upon stout paddles and wield
them furiously.</p>

<p>It was intended to reach a certain point in the
river before turning the prow of the craft down
toward the head of the rapids.</p>

<p>Long familiarity, every day in the week during
the season, and many times a day, had made
every rock and swirl known to these men. But
although they knew the main channel like a book,
seldom did any crew dare venture as close to the
terrible jaws of the whirlpool as the veteran guide
of the rapids, Old John Boucher, had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
made it a practice of taking his parties.</p>

<p>Jack had looked several times at the man in the
stern. Somehow, he did not wholly like his appearance.
There was something about him to
signify that he must have recently arisen from a
sick bed. Perhaps, tempted by an influx of
tourists, and the demand for experienced guides
to take them through the rapids, he had come
back to work a bit too soon!</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem as strong as the others,&rdquo;
Jack was thinking, even as he turned his head
from time to time as if to see what lay behind,
while they were pushing up the sturdy current.
&ldquo;I can hear him pant as if short of breath.
Goodness! I hope now nothing is going to happen
to him while we&rsquo;re spinning along down through
these old rapids. They say that whirlpool would
swallow up anything; and that Old John was the
only man whoever went into it, and came out
alive. Whew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jack did not whisper these fears to his
comrades. It was too late to change steersman
now; and why spoil all their pleasure?</p>

<p>After all, no doubt there was not so much
strength needed once they began to move
swiftly along with the current, going half a mile
in a couple of minutes, they had been told,
though Jack doubted the accuracy of that statement
at first.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Apparently the guides had overshot the mark
at which they aimed; for as the canoe was turned,
in the shadow of the bridge, Jack saw that the
man in the bow glanced apprehensively over his
shoulder while he knelt there, and immediately
began to paddle furiously, as though trying to
bring the boat back a little toward the American
shore.</p>

<p>Had they gone too far, and were they speeding
down in the track taken by the one daring prince
of guides&mdash;a course that would actually skirt the
verge of that whirlpool, of which such terrible
things were said?</p>

<p>Jack shut his teeth hard at the thought. Then
he gave himself up to the keen enjoyment of that
glorious ride, when the canoe was seized upon as
by invisible hands, and borne along at lightning
speed.</p>

<p>Looking at the water alongside, foam-specked
as it was, one could not believe the boat was
moving at all, because both kept company. But
all that was needed was for the voyager to raise
his eyes, and send a look toward the shore, when
he must realize the tremendous rapidity with
which his frail craft was being carried along.</p>

<p>Things just seemed to fairly flit past, as though
they were aboard a fast railway train. The boys
were evidently enjoying the novel experience to
the full, for their heads were constantly turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
from side to side, and all seemed to be talking at
once.</p>

<p>Jack was nervously looking ahead and on the
left, for he knew they must now be approaching
the whirlpool, where the eddying waters went
furiously round and round and the center seemed
to be a deep hole, like the dent a gigantic top
would make in the mud.</p>

<p>Yes, there it was beyond, and they were speeding
down at a pace that made one dizzy to notice
it. He could feel that both Indian guides were
paddling desperately <i>away from the left</i>, as
though fearing that they were too close to the
verge of that death chasm!</p>

<p>What if a paddle chanced to break right then
and there? They carried spare ones fortunately&mdash;Jack
had noted that; but all the same he hoped
nothing of the sort would come about.</p>

<p>Hardly had this chilly idea flashed into Jack&rsquo;s
mind than he heard what seemed to be a groan
close to his ear. At the same time he felt the
boat quiver in a suspicious manner. Turning
instantly the boy was horrified to see that the
Indian guide in the rear had crumpled in his
place, with his head fallen forward, and seemed
to be gasping for breath.</p>

<p>He had collapsed just at the most dreadful
moment, when the canoe was swooping down
close to the edge of the whirlpool!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3>WINNING AN INDIAN&rsquo;S ADMIRATION</h3>


<p>Fortunately for all of them, Jack Stormways
was not given to fear. In emergencies he acted
from intuition, rather than through thinking
things out, no matter however speedily.</p>

<p>There may come times when a second counts
for everything. Jack believed such an occasion
was now upon them; and he acted instantly.</p>

<p>The man in falling forward had pushed his
paddle alongside Jack. It was as plain an invitation
to fill his place as could have been given.</p>

<p>Making one swoop the boy snatched up the
stout blade, and instantly dipped it over the
port side. Desperately he exerted his strength
to steer the canoe away from the fatal eddies
that sought to draw them still further into the
vortex.</p>

<p>The Indian in the bow may have suspected
something of what had occurred; but he dared
not turn his head now, or take his attention away
from the rocks ahead for even one lone second.</p>

<p>As for the five boys, they were all staring at the
near-by whirlpool as though actually fascinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
by its terrors; and not suspecting how close they
were to plunging straight into its grip.</p>

<p>With every atom of his strength did Jack work,
dipping as deeply as he could, and striving
against the giant power of the mill race on which
they were speeding.</p>

<p>The edge of the circling current was horribly
close; in fact they seemed to skirt its very border,
closer perhaps than even the veteran guide ever
carried his cargoes of tourists, when in his prime.</p>

<p>Jack fairly held his breath as the crisis came.
He did not know, could not tell whether they
would win out or not. It was an experience that
would doubtless continue to haunt the lad for a
long time. Perhaps he would awaken in the
night with a start and a low cry, having dreamed
that once again he sat in the canoe with the dark
skinned steersman fallen in a faint, and the
hungry maw of the whirlpool yawning so very
close on their left that one could have tossed a
chip directly into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! wasn&rsquo;t that a close shave though,
boys?&rdquo; shouted George, half turning his head to
look at his mates; and then following his words
with another cry: &ldquo;Look at Jack, would you?
Great governor! what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as the others twisted around to look, they
were amazed to discover that Jack was wielding
that paddle like a veteran, his face as white as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
chalk, and his eyes staring; but his teeth firmly
pressed together, with a look of grim determination
on his young face.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken until they had passed
the last bristling rock, and spun out below where
the foamy water took on a less violent aspect.</p>

<p>Then Bedlam broke loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit still, all of you!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he saw a
movement on the part of his chums to get up;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll upset the canoe yet, if you try that.
Wait till we reach the shore, and you&rsquo;ll know
about it. The man has fainted, that&rsquo;s all; and
I had to take his place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was all right when we started, for I
looked around and saw him,&rdquo; declared Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;He keeled
over just before we got to the whirlpool, and as he
dropped his paddle right beside me, all I had to
do was to dip it in, and exert myself a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little!&rdquo; echoed George, with thrilling emphasis,
&ldquo;look at the beads of sweat on his forehead,
fellows! Jack, honest now, you must have
saved all our lives. Ugh! just to think, if the
boat had swerved then, where would we be right
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and turned paler
than when passing through the yeasty waters of
the rapids. But Jack tried to make light of it all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! shucks!&rdquo; he laughed, though his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
trembled a bit in spite of his wonderful nerve;
&ldquo;any of you would have done the same thing.
Why, there was nothing else to do, to tell the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; exclaimed Nick; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure have been so
frozen with horror that all I could do would have
been to grab hold of the boat, and shut my eyes.
Kept &rsquo;em shut part of the time, anyhow. Felt
like I had an awful temptation to just jump out
of the boat, and into that nice water that was
singing and gurgling along beside us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d better never try the rapids any
more then, Buster,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s the
way it affected you. I remember now hearing
you say you never was able to walk on the ties
of a railroad bridge, or look over a precipice, because
something made you dizzy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached the shore near the small house
where Old John Boucher and his family, one of
the sons said to be a preacher, lived in the days
gone by. When the boys climbed out of the
canoe, the Indian stepped in to help his comrade,
who had by then come out of his swoon, and was
able to feebly walk.</p>

<p>To the surprise of Jack the Indian who had
been in the bow stopped to hold out his hard-skinned
hand, and squeeze that of the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Jack all right! Think it all over
with everybody when Jim he fall. But you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
do right, think. Bully!&rdquo; was what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted Nick, waving his new hat
wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers and a tiger for our commodore!&rdquo;
exclaimed George; and they were given with a
vim that caused many on the stone walk along
the canal embankment to look down in wonder
toward the little group.</p>

<p>Nor would the guide accept any pay for the
trip. They could not force it on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ride with me all time, and not cent pay,
Jack!&rdquo; he declared, his black eyes sparkling with
sincere admiration as he looked in the face of the
white boy.</p>

<p>Of course the voyagers had lots to talk about
while they continued their exploration of the
city on the great canal. They even climbed the
hill near where the government barracks stood
during the Spanish-American war, and obtained
a fine view of the entire neighborhood. Yet
nothing attracted their attention as did the ever
rushing rapids, where the waters of the greatest
inland sea in the world emptied into the river
that was to bear them through the other lakes
in the chain, and by way of the St. Lawrence
River, to the far-distant sea.</p>

<p>The thrilling adventure had apparently sobered
the boys too, for there was much less
horse play than usual, nor were jokes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
order for the balance of that day.</p>

<p>Having some time to spare they took the ferryboat,
and crossed to the Canadian side of the
river below the rapids. Here they viewed the
other canal, through which considerable commerce
also passes, principally Canadian.</p>

<p>They also took advantage of their &ldquo;visit
abroad,&rdquo; as George called it, to inspect the big
pulp mills, where spruce logs were ground up,
and made into sheets that would later on become
paper.</p>

<p>The latter end of the day was put in securing
provisions calculated to last for a week or more,
since they could not tell when another chance to
procure supplies might come their way, once they
embarked upon the bosom of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Nick was once more in his element. He suggested
all sorts of things that he had read about
in his cook book. Had they sent him forth, with
plenty of money and unlimited assurance, the
chances were, as George declared, the expedition
would have had to hire another boat, just to
transport the stuff that fellow would have flooded
them with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;d buy out a whole grocery store,
given half a chance,&rdquo; said Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve got all the stuff right now we can
stow away comfortably,&rdquo; declared Herb, scratching
his head as he contemplated the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
packages, and then looking toward his boat
near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as we suggested before, Herb,&rdquo; said Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; demanded Nick, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make Buster take up his quarters in the
dinky. It&rsquo;ll be a ride that might take the shine
off even that dash down the rapids.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any,&rdquo; asserted the fat boy strenuously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too heavy for such monkey shines. Josh
likes the water better than I do. You all saw
how he can dive so gracefully just as if he had
taken lessons from a granddaddy frog. If anybody
has to be quartered in a dinky to make
room, he&rsquo;s the chap, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But after a while the last package was put
away, and places found for all.</p>

<p>George drew Jack aside as the others were
arranging things aboard the various boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making a few inquiries as to
whether another small motor boat went through
here,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, I&rsquo;d come near forgetting Clarence,&rdquo;
laughed Jack. &ldquo;And I suppose he took the canal
several days ago. He must have gained on us
while we were losing time, stuck in the mud,
stormbound and such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t go through here, anyhow,&rdquo;
replied George. &ldquo;And the chances are ten to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
one he&rsquo;d never think of using the Canadian locks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he had a good start of us,&rdquo; remarked his
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do you think the <i>Wireless</i> is bound to
monopolize <i>all</i> the mud in the St. Mary&rsquo;s river?&rdquo;
exclaimed George, indignantly. &ldquo;I guess Clarence
has stuck somewhere on the way up; and
as he didn&rsquo;t have any bully chums to pull him
off he&rsquo;s there yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see anything of him,&rdquo; mused Jack;
&ldquo;but then, there were lots of times when we had
a choice of channels. Even the big boats take
one of two that are buoyed and targeted. Yes,
Clarence might have chosen one we let alone.
But of course, if he hasn&rsquo;t passed through the
canal, he must still be below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; George remarked, gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, because you&rsquo;re only thinking of
that grand race you expected to pull off with your
old rival, sooner or later. But the less I see of
Clarence the better I&rsquo;m pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we go ashore to a restaurant tonight,
Jack?&rdquo; continued the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the others decide,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;As
for me, I think it would be the best thing to do.
Josh is being overworked, as it is, and needs a
little rest. Besides, Buster will be tickled, because
that would leave more grub in the bunch
for the future.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Jocko, the monkey, had made himself
quite at home with the boys. They took turns
having him aboard, and he furnished considerable
fun for the crowd with his antics. As yet
he had not become quite reconciled to Nick, and
always showed his white teeth whenever the fat
boy came around. But by treating him to
choice bits of food Buster was winning the little
chap over by degrees.</p>

<p>The balance were of the same mind as Jack
when the proposition was put up to them. And
accordingly they went to dinner in two detachments,
Nick being with the first, and serving as a
connecting link between both; for he was still
there when Jack, Jimmie and George arrived at
the eatinghouse; and sat them out in the bargain.</p>

<p>Still, the second squad had enough, and could
not complain that Nick had made a famine in
that particular restaurant; which Josh had hinted
was possible, when telling them how the fat boy
had refused to leave when they did.</p>

<p>It was an entirely different night they spent
there at the Soo, from most of the quiet ones of
the trip. Much noise continued throughout the
livelong night; for the lock is lighted by electricity,
and vessels can keep passing up and down
the nineteen feet rise and fall at any and
all hours.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Frequently during the night the hoarse whistle
of some big steamer, or a tug towing whaleback
barges, would sound close at hand, awakening
those who were not accustomed to this bustling
nature of things.</p>

<p>In the morning all of them declared that they
had passed an uneasy night; and professed to be
delighted because it would not be repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight we hope to be in camp somewhere
along the quiet shore of the Big Lake,&rdquo; said
George, yawning and stretching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Jack, with kindling eyes, &ldquo;where
those whoppers of speckled beauties are to be
found, if looked for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yum! yum! speed the hour!&rdquo; mumbled Nick;
and of course no one needed to be told that already
his thoughts were turning to the glowing
camp fire, and the tempting odors that would
arise when the coffee pot was on, and the pink
trout sputtering in the several fryingpans.</p>

<p>And shortly afterward, breakfast having been
eaten at the same restaurant, which had evidently
laid in a new lot of supplies since their last
raid, they entered the big lock, to have the boats
elevated to the upper level.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3>THE GREAT INLAND SEA</h3>


<p>It was just ten o&rsquo;clock when the trio of little
motor boats started out of the canal, and headed
for the open lake far beyond. Long afterward
they could look back, and see the stone electricity
building between the two locks of the canal; and
in imagination the picture as viewed from its top
would haunt them, with the churning rapids
occupying the center of the scene.</p>

<p>Leaving the canal at its juncture with the
river, they were soon in the neck of the lake. Far
as the eye could reach, and many times farther,
stretched the sparkling water, as clear as crystal;
and cold enough to satisfy any one, even on as
hot a day as this August one promised to be.</p>

<p>At noon they found a good chance to go ashore.
Nick of course was solemnly warned that this
was sacred Canadian soil, and that on no account
was he to try and purloin any strangely marked
animals he might discover prowling around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know they have some queer beasts in
these foreign lands, Buster,&rdquo; George remarked,
shaking a finger before the other&rsquo;s stubby nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
&ldquo;And make up your mind right now that you&rsquo;re
going to let &rsquo;em all severely alone. Some time
you can join an expedition sent out to Africa, to
scoop up all sorts of freak cats and sich; but
while you&rsquo;re with us we&rsquo;d rather you restrained
that curiosity of yours. It&rsquo;s going to get you
in trouble, some fine day, Buster, you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for you, George. Just wait, and
see if I don&rsquo;t have a chance to get back on you
yet,&rdquo; replied the other, complacently. &ldquo;But
would you look at Josh, what he&rsquo;s bringing ashore
now? Fish, as sure as you live. Bully for Josh!
White fish, too, the best that grow in these
waters, barring none. Tell us, where did you
catch &rsquo;em, Josh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a silver hook, and from one of the Indian
guides,&rdquo; replied the cook. &ldquo;He netted
&rsquo;em in the rapids, I guess. Heard that earlier
in the season they get tons and tons of fish that
way; two men in a boat, one in the bow to use
the net, and the other to hold the canoe against
the current with a pole. Bet you they&rsquo;ll eat
fine, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you clean &rsquo;em, Josh,&rdquo; volunteered
Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then; get busy, Buster. Anyhow,
you know a good thing when you see it,&rdquo; returned
the cook, only too willing to hand over the disagreeable
task.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked George, as he and Jack lay
there in the shade, waiting for the lunch call;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re well on our way to the Agawa river
region. Think we&rsquo;ll make it today, commodore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;In the first
place it looks dubious over yonder, as though we
might get one of these famous Lake Superior
storms you read about. If that drops in on us,
we wouldn&rsquo;t like to be caught out on the open,
you know, George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, excuse me, if you please,&rdquo; returned the
other, with a shrug of his shoulders that spoke
louder than his words. &ldquo;Storms and my speed
boat don&rsquo;t seem to agree very well. When one
comes hustling along I prefer to be behind some
sort of shelter, where I can laugh at the wind and
the waves. But you spoke as if there might be
still another reason for our not getting to the
river tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;This time you
may have the laugh on Herb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that the
staunch old engine in the <i>Comfort</i> has been up
to any antics?&rdquo; exclaimed George; not without
a touch of exultation in his voice; for Herb had
jeered at him so many times, on account of his
troubles, it was only natural that he should feel
a little gratification to know there were others.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it developed after we left the Soo,&rdquo; Jack
went on. &ldquo;Just like these mean things always
do, you know. He&rsquo;s been limping along for the
last half hour. Of course there&rsquo;s no telling how
serious it may be. Let&rsquo;s hope we can fix it in
short order. Some of us had better get at it
right after lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anybody can put it in apple pie order I
guess you can, Jack,&rdquo; George said; &ldquo;and if you
need any help call on me, because you know
Herb isn&rsquo;t much of a mechanic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of you, George,&rdquo; said Herb, who
happened to be coming over to where the two
were talking at the time. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best
thing about the motor boat boys; they like to
josh each other, and get lots of fun out of things;
but when it comes right down to trouble there
isn&rsquo;t one of them who wouldn&rsquo;t do everything in
his power to help a chum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The call to eat caused them to make haste to
gather around. In fact, there was always an
involuntary sort of race to the mess table when
the meals were eaten on shore, so that all partook.
On this very day Josh noticed this fact
particularly and made mention of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, do you know you fellows are that prompt
you just seem to jump into your places?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I start to pound a fryingpan with my big
spoon, and before I get in five licks all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
you are in a ring waiting for grub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted George, &ldquo;nothing funny about
that. We have to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick of course took that as a reflection on him,
and bridled up at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unkind of you, George,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;I was never known to take any fellow&rsquo;s share.
An equal division is my rule always. And if
some one chooses to decline a portion of his
prog; and my appetite is not satisfied, what
harm in commandeering the remains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re all right, Pudding; George is only
tapping you as he does us all, when he gets the
chance,&rdquo; Herb said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I take my punishment decently, when
my turn comes, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; demanded George, as
he received a generous portion of a delicious
white fish, which had been rolled in egg, and
cracker crumbs, and then cooked and browned
in the grease from some salt pork placed in hot
pans until it fried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you do;&rdquo; Jack laughingly remarked.
&ldquo;And now forget all your troubles, fellows, and
get down to work. Look out for bones. I&rsquo;ve
eaten white fish plenty of times, and they say
they&rsquo;re never so good unless cooked right where
they&rsquo;re caught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it too,&rdquo; Josh continued. &ldquo;Just like
the pompano an uncle of mine used to tell us he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
caught down in Florida&mdash;used to jump in the
boat, he said; and as they&rsquo;re a delicate, white-flesh
fish like this, putting them on ice a week or
so takes the flavor out. It also makes them
crumble up when cooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it, Buster?&rdquo; Herb asked; but Nick
only rolled his eyes, and kept on munching as
though the fate of nations depended on his ability
to clear off his tin platter within a given time.</p>

<p>When Nick was eating he wasted mighty little
breath in talking, leaving all of that for more
convenient times. Besides, he had a perfect
horror of some time getting a fish bone in his
throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t matter much with a lanky fellow
like Josh, you see,&rdquo; he once said, in commenting
on this fear; &ldquo;because anybody could stick his
fist down, and yank the fish-bone out; but my
neck is so fat I&rsquo;d choke to death long before you
could say Jack Robinson. So don&rsquo;t bother me
when I&rsquo;m eating fish, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Afterwards Jack and George took a look at the
engine of the <i>Comfort</i>. After doing a little tinkering
they announced that it would probably
run fairly well during the afternoon; but before
starting on another day&rsquo;s trip more would have
to be done to it.</p>

<p>This was not very comforting to Herb; but
he made the best of a bad bargain; and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
light hearts the motor boys again started forth.</p>

<p>Jack kept an anxious eye on the southwestern
sky. He did not altogether like the looks of
things in that particular quarter, and was resolved
that if they discovered a promising campsite
in the afternoon, they could not afford to
pass it by, if it afforded an offing for the boats.</p>

<p>That tremendous sea, stretching for several
hundred miles away to the west, opened appalling
possibilities in the way of a gale. The
staunchest steamers that ever plied the fresh
water seas would sometimes be as putty in the
grasp of a summer storm; and what of the three
puny mosquito craft that were as chips on the
water?</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock Herb announced that his
engine was getting worse instead of better. And
about the same time a welcome hail from George,
who was moving along in the van as usual, told
that he had by the aid of his glasses sighted a
shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s us to go ashore,&rdquo; declared Jack; nor
was any one sorry in their hearts; since a little
while before a distant sound like thunder had
been borne to their ears from the low-down patch
of hovering clouds.</p>

<p>The retreat promised to be all the shelter they
wanted, though it would hardly have answered
for larger boats. Immediately all became as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
busy as beavers, the two tents being raised, and
stoutly secured, so that any ordinary gale could
not carry the canvas off like a balloon.</p>

<p>Jack had hardly finished his share of the work
before he got out his rod, and busied himself in
trying for trout; for he fancied that they were
to be found in the clear waters near by this cove,
where a limpid little stream emptied into the
Great Lake.</p>

<p>Nick, they all noticed, stuck close to camp. It
would have to be something very attractive that
could induce <i>him</i> to wander far from his fireside,
especially when the camp was pitched on Canadian
soil, where they grew such queer kitties.</p>

<p>This time it was Jimmie who seemed destined
to get into a peck of trouble. Jack always declared
that there seemed to be an evil spirit
forever hovering around their camp, looking for
chances to accomplish his work; and let there appear
the least kind of an opening, and he was
ready to jump in.</p>

<p>Jimmie was not much of a hunter or fisherman,
though able to do either on occasion. But
he did have a little fancy for wild flowers, and
liked to pry around on occasion, seeing what he
could discover.</p>

<p>Now, at this late day in the season, he knew
he was not apt to run across any of these pretty
gems of the woods; but there seemed to be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sort of fascination about poking here and there
examining a bunch of magnificent moss of a pattern
he had never set eyes on before, measuring
some giant ferns, and watching the antics of a
family of squirrels. These had their home in an
old hollow tree close by, and seemed filled with
mild curiosity concerning the intruders on two
legs that had taken up quarters so boldly adjoining
the cove.</p>

<p>Herb and George were busily engaged with
the balky engine, trying to find out just what
ailed the thing, so that it could be remedied
once and for all. In the end they felt positive that
the blame could be located and effectually
cured. At least it was to be hoped so; otherwise
the <i>Tramp</i> would have to tow the larger boat
back to the Soo, where the trouble could be
abated at the hands of a machinist.</p>

<p>Josh, according to his custom, was pottering
around the camp, making a better fireplace out
of stones, at which he could carry out his part
of the business with more comfort and dispatch.
If they had been going to remain any length of
time here, Josh would have constructed a
&ldquo;cooker&rdquo; worth looking at; for he was an artist
in this particular line.</p>

<p>Nick was apparently quite content to lie
around, &ldquo;getting up an appetite for the next
meal,&rdquo; as Josh sarcastically remarked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as if that were at all necessary,&rdquo; was
what the fat boy hurled back at him; and the argument
was so clinching that Josh subsided on
the spot; for no one had ever seen the time when
Buster&rsquo;s appetite needed to be coaxed.</p>

<p>Nick&rsquo;s eyes finally alighted on the repeating
gun which Jack had leaned against a tree at a
point where it would be out of harm&rsquo;s way.
Now, Nick himself had seldom fired a gun,
though ambitious to become a sportsman; because,
as he wisely observed, &ldquo;if I happened to
be left in the woods some time, think I want to
starve to death, with a gun in my hands, and
plenty of fat game all around me? Not much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in that spirit he had picked up the Marlin;
bringing it to his shoulder in a clumsy way, time
after time, in order to get accustomed to the
movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep the muzzle turned the other way, Buster!&rdquo;
commanded Josh, noticing that he was
working the pump action of the six-shot weapon,
as if he liked to see the ejector send the shell
flying out at one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I know enough for that Josh,&rdquo; grumbled
Nick, but at the same time moving still
farther around, so that the cook might lose his
fears; for when a meal was being prepared the
fat boy always handled Josh with gloves, as
he frankly admitted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was just as he was sitting thus that a sudden
scream rang through the neighboring woods,
sounding so shrill and angry that every one
started as though a bolt of lightning had fallen
from the clear blue vault overhead right into
their midst, and exploded there!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3>NICK WIPES OUT HIS DISGRACE</h3>


<p>Everybody in the camp jumped up.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned toward the point from
which this racket sprang; and it was a strange
sight that immediately met their astonished
eyes. Jimmie was jumping about as though he
had accidentally stepped into a bee&rsquo;s nest, and
was now engaged in a hand-to-hand fight with
the entire swarm.</p>

<p>Nick happened to be in a position where he
could see better than any of his companions.
And he immediately discovered that the troubles
of the Irish lad were not at all imaginary.</p>

<p>Something was leaping back and forth, now
threatening to land on the shoulders of Jimmie,
and then springing to the low limb of a tree, or it
might be the ground.</p>

<p>Nick had never before set eyes on such a
strange creature, yet he realized that it was a wild
animal. His late unpleasant experience was of
course still fresh in his mind; and his first suspicion
may have been that this was another specimen
of a Canadian pussy cat.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever it was, Jimmie seemed to be having
the time of his life fighting. True to his inherited
instincts, the Irish lad had snatched up some
sort of stick, to serve him as a shillalah. It was
a stout bit of wood too, and he wielded it in a
manner that proved him to be a &ldquo;broth of a boy.&rdquo;
Several times it landed with a resounding whack
upon the flying body of his antagonist, and at
each connection the unknown beast was hurled
heavily backward.</p>

<p>But evidently the furious animal was grim and
determined. Instead of being cowed by these
temporary setbacks it only resumed the attack
with added zeal; so that Jimmie had often to
throw up his left arm in addition, to fend off his
foe.</p>

<p>Now, Nick chanced to remember that at the
very moment he was holding a gun in his hands.
With one of his chums in grave peril it seemed to
devolve upon him to engineer a rescue party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys! Jimmie needs help!&rdquo; he
shouted, starting to run forward as well as his
bulk admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful of that gun, Buster!&rdquo; called Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t shoot Jimmie instead!&rdquo; added
Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your fire till you can get &rsquo;em separated!&rdquo;
supplemented George; who being a little farther
away at the time, managed to bring up the rear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way then the quartette started to the
assistance of Jimmie, who was still whanging
away with might and main. What with the
loud shouts of the aroused Irish lad, the whoops
of the runners, and the angry snarling of the
enraged beast, one would think a menagerie
must have broken loose in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Just then George happened to get a good look
at the beast as it jumped up on the limb, and
whirling, crouched to make another leap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wildcat!&rdquo; he shouted as loud as he
could. &ldquo;Be careful, Nick! Don&rsquo;t you try to
grab it now, on your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick heard, but was too busy to think of replying.
The cat had sprung again at the pugnacious
Irish boy, to be met with another smart
thump that landed with a loud thud, and sent
the beast sprawling to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye would, hey?&rdquo; howled Jimmie in derision,
though the blood was streaked upon his face,
where the sharp claws of the beast had scratched
him. &ldquo;Thry for it again, plaze! And be the
powers, ye&rsquo;ll foind Jimmie Brannagan at home
whin ye knock at the dure. Come on, ye omadhaun!
I&rsquo;ll soon knock all the breath out of the
body of ye! Wow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Canadian cat was a fighter. It looked it
every inch, now that the defiant defense of the
intruder had aroused its fury. Once more it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sprang to the limb of the tree, as though recognizing
that here it had a better chance to leap
than from the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now! Buster! But be careful! Keep back
Jimmie!&rdquo; shouted George.</p>

<p>The others held their very breath, for they saw
that Nick had the Marlin repeater up at his
bulky shoulder. Perhaps every one of them was
mentally hoping that he would not shut his eyes
while pulling the trigger; for a little swerve might
bring Jimmie within range, and the result be
disastrous at that short distance.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Instantly a series of whoops broke forth, and
every fellow started forward once more, as
though meaning to be in at the death. George
and Herb and Josh had each managed to possess
himself of some sort of improvised weapon. The
first had in his hand a hatchet which he had been
using at the time; Josh was waving his favorite
big spoon, with which he was wont to beat the
summons to meals on a pan; and the skipper of
the <i>Comfort</i> had picked up a billet of wood while
passing the fire, which he now flourished eagerly
above his head.</p>

<p>Nick himself stood there, struggling with the
pump-gun. As usual with novices he could not
work the mechanism; for in his excitement he
was trying to fire without having ejected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
used shell; and no self-respecting modern arm
will stand for that sort of treatment.</p>

<p>Fortunately all around, no second shot was
needed. The animal was kicking its last upon
the ground, and emitting agonizing screams of
anger and pain. Whether by accident or real
accuracy of aim, Nick had apparently managed
to send the contents of the shell where it counted.</p>

<p>Already Jimmie was indulging in what seemed
to be a war dance, waving his stick, and singing.
George was compelled to laugh just to see his
antics, streaked as his freckled face was with
smootches of his own gore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye done it, Buster, sure ye knocked the silly
gossoon clane over!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a broth
of a boy ye arre, and afther me own heart. Look
at the baste, would ye? If he hasn&rsquo;t got tassels
on his ears!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; declared George, now arriving
to see the last kick of the animal on the ground,
and note the unquenchable fury shown to the
very end. &ldquo;Why, I tell you what it is fellows.
A Canadian lynx, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does look different from my cat&mdash;er, that
other animal,&rdquo; admitted Nick, as he cautiously
advanced, evidently ready to beat a hasty retreat
should he discover any need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of the missing links,&rdquo; spoke up
Josh; &ldquo;but we never lost any; so this critter
couldn&rsquo;t belong to us.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A good shot, Buster, old man!&rdquo; declared
George, bending down to see where the charge
had struck the beast while crouching on the
limb, and preparing for still another leap at
Jimmie.</p>

<p>Nick swelled up with importance. Apparently
this was one of the few occasions when he
could assume an attitude, and receive congratulations.
Usually it was just the other way; and
like a wise fellow he believed in making hay while
the sun shone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! pretty fair, considering how quick I had
to shoot!&rdquo; he remarked, carelessly, as much as to
say that, given a little more time, and he could
have done better.</p>

<p>Jack now came running up, having of course
heard all the row, and being consumed with curiosity
to know its meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he called, as he ran. &ldquo;Another
Canada pussy cat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it is,&rdquo; replied George
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is Buster at his old tricks again?&rdquo; continued
the other; at which Nick was compelled
to grin amiably, knowing his hour of triumph
was at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buster was in the mix-up, all right,&rdquo; George
went on; &ldquo;only this time he happened to be at
the other end of the gun. Buster has covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
himself with immortal glory. We all must
knuckle down to him after this as the great
Nimrod; for he has just slain the Jabberwock.
Looky here, Jack; what d&rsquo;ye call that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, a big Canada lynx!&rdquo; cried
the newcomer, recognizing the dead beast as
soon as he saw its queer tasseled ears, and its
ferocious whiskers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It tackled Jimmie here, and they were having
a hot old argument of it, Jimmie pounding with
his club, and the cat using its claws,&rdquo; Herb said,
turning to the Irish boy, to see how badly he was
wounded.</p>

<p>Jack became sympathetic at once, and anxious
in the bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a few little scratches you say, Jimmie,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, they don&rsquo;t seem
serious; but it&rsquo;s always dangerous to be marked
with the claws of animals that live on carrion,
like lions, grizzlies or wildcats. And I&rsquo;m glad
to say I&rsquo;ve got something along for just such a
case. Come on back to camp with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmie, still protesting, did so; while the
others, dragging the lynx, made Buster head the
procession, while they sang: &ldquo;Lo! the Conquering
Hero Comes; Sound the Trumpets, Beat the
Drums!&rdquo; greatly to the delight of the fat boy.</p>

<p>When Jack applied the purple colored tincture
from a small bottle to the wounds on Jimmie&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
face and hands, the Irish boy gave a whoop of
pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, the rimedy is worse nor the disease!&rdquo;
he complained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;just stand the
pain for a little. It&rsquo;s an insurance against blood
poisoning. Many a hunter has lost his life from
little cuts no worse than yours, when they were
caused by the claws of a wild beast. My father
would not let me come out unless I carried this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack?&rdquo; asked Herb, curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strong tincture of permanganate of potash,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;Just remember that, will you;
and it&rsquo;s got to be powerful enough to hurt like
fun; eh, Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indade it did, that,&rdquo; was the immediate response;
while the Irish boy screwed up his good
humored face in a knot.</p>

<p>Jack went back to his fishing, for he had already
managed to take one pretty good specimen
of the Lake Superior speckled trout that would
have weighed nearly four pounds; and was eager
for more.</p>

<p>All the while he sat there, employing every device
he knew of to tempt the finny denizens of
the depths to bite, he kept one eye to windward.
That low bank of clouds interested him; for it
seemed to presage a storm.</p>

<p>Since everything possible had been attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to in order to ward off any evil effects of a gale,
Jack did not stop fishing until he had succeeded
in catching a fine mess, that would please the
heart of Buster.</p>

<p>Josh was preparing the fish as fast as they were
caught. Indeed, he dispatched Nick several
times to see if there were any more forthcoming;
when the sportsman would toss ashore his latest
catch, and the cook&rsquo;s assistant hurry back with
the prize, his hungry eyes fairly glistening with
anticipation.</p>

<p>Of course it was a royally good supper that
followed. Josh cooked the trout in the same
capable manner he had served the lake white
fish; and every fellow declared they had never
tasted anything more delicious.</p>

<p>Still, there was plenty for all, and to spare.
Even Nick had to shut his eyes with a deep sigh,
because he had reached the extreme limit of his
capacity; and a pan of trout remained untouched.</p>

<p>The growling of the thunder now became more
pronounced. Across the heavens the zigzag
lightning shot, in a way that was as terrible as it
was fascinating. Supper done, the boys clustered
near the fire, talking, and watching the
coming of the gale. Again and again had Jack
and George gone around, to see that every tent
peg was clinched in the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to hold, unless the wind tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the blessed things to flinders!&rdquo; Jack had announced;
and at the same time he had seen to it that
the boats were protected by the friendly point
of land from the giant waves that would soon be
sweeping in from the sea beyond.</p>

<p>Already were they rising in majestic grandeur
that was awe inspiring. The storm was about
to swoop down upon the shore line, and hurl the
rising sea against the mighty rocky barrier, as it
had done for countless ages past without success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! ain&rsquo;t I just glad I&rsquo;m not out there!&rdquo; exclaimed
Nick, as he shudderingly surveyed the
darkening picture of warring elements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But look there, fellows; what d&rsquo;ye call that?&rdquo;
cried Herb, as he pointed a quivering finger at
some object that had suddenly come in sight
from the east.</p>

<p>It was a little motor boat, wallowing in the
rising sea, and doomed to certain destruction
unless able to make shelter immediately. And
with the waves dashing wildly against the rocks,
those aboard would never see the small opening
through which the motor boat boys had come to
their present snug harbor!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Flash</i>!&rdquo; shouted Jack; &ldquo;and unless
we manage to show them the way in, it&rsquo;s good-bye
to Clarence and Bully Joe! We must do it, fellows.
Come on!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3>HELPING AN ENEMY</h3>


<p>Jack kept his wits about him.</p>

<p>He had snatched up something as he ran to the
very point where he might best be seen through
the flying spray. It was the conch shell which,
with its apex sawed off, made a horn or trumpet
that could be heard a mile away, under even the
most discouraging conditions.</p>

<p>Reaching the point for which he had been aiming
Jack immediately started sending a hoarse
blast out over that tumultuous sea. The others
waved their hats, and made suggestive motions
toward the small inlet, to show that a boat could
enter the cove where the stream of water emptied
into the Big Lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They see us!&rdquo; shrilled Nick, dancing up and
down in his excitement; for in this moment all
past animosity was forgotten, because human
lives seemed in jeopardy&mdash;the lives of those who
had gone to school, and played baseball with
them, in the days that were past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re waving their hands!&rdquo; declared
Herb.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now they put about!&rdquo; George added.
&ldquo;Careful there, Clarence! You nearly keeled
over then on your beam ends. That was a narrow
squeak! I&rsquo;d hate to have the poor old
<i>Flash</i> meet such a fate, not to speak of her crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now, fellows!&rdquo; cried Jack.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re heading for the inlet. Run over, and
be ready to give any help needed. In times like
this let&rsquo;s forget that Clarence and Joe have always
been up against us. We&rsquo;re all Americans
now; and we must stick together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully talk!&rdquo; said Josh, hastening after George
and Jack, leaving Nick to amble along in the
rear.</p>

<p>Clarence knew how to handle his boat with
considerable skill; and once he drew close in, he
was able to see how the ground lay. Those on
shore also directed him as best they could; and
the net result was that the <i>Flash</i> finally shot
around the point, arriving in the little sheltered
bay that a kind nature seemed to have provided
for just such emergencies.</p>

<p>As Jack had more than once said, could they
but look back hundreds of years, no doubt they
would find that it had sheltered fleets of Indian
canoes many a time, when the storm king rode
the waves of the Great Lake.</p>

<p>When the <i>Flash</i> had been moored safely, her
crew came ashore. Joe Brinker was looking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
bit sullen, as though he did not much fancy the
idea of accepting aid from these fellows, whom
he had always looked upon as enemies. But
Clarence walked straight up to Jack, holding out
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s mighty decent of you, Stormways,
to throw us a line this way,&rdquo; he declared, with
considerable feeling. &ldquo;I admit I was badly
rattled, and thought we were in for a wreck.
Neither of us glimpsed this opening here, and
we&rsquo;d sure have swept by, if you hadn&rsquo;t signalled.
I&rsquo;m sorry now I ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let by-gones be forgotten while we&rsquo;re here,
Clarence,&rdquo; spoke up Jack. &ldquo;See, the storm is
whooping things up out there now, and it&rsquo;s just
as well you&rsquo;re not on the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clarence did look, and shuddered at what he
saw; for it was not a pleasant spectacle, with the
lightning flashes, and the heaving billows, seen
through the flying spray that even reached them
by the tents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get busy, fellows!&rdquo; George called. &ldquo;Carry
everything inside. Yes, take that pan of fish,
and the coffee, Nick. I guess our callers are
hungry, and will be glad of a bite. Quick now,
for here she comes with a rush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had they found shelter, and the flaps
of the tents been secured, when down the rain
pelted, to the accompaniment of the most tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thunder crashes any of them had ever
heard; while the fierce wind tried its best to tear
the canvas shelters from over their heads.</p>

<p>But the work had been well done, and the
tents stood, though wobbling more or less under
the fierce onset of the wind.</p>

<p>Clarence and Joe had been taken in with Jack
and George, while the other four occupied the
second tent. Seated on the ground, the two
newcomers proceeded to break their fast, and
drink what remained of the coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you wonder what kept us back so
long?&rdquo; remarked Clarence, after they had finished
the meal, and while a little lull came in the
tempest without.</p>

<p>Jack and George looked at each other and
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might give a good think,&rdquo; remarked the
latter; &ldquo;seeing that I pushed the nose of my
<i>Wireless</i> boat so hard into Mud Lake that it took
an hour and more for the other two to pull me
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! that&rsquo;s where you were lucky, then,
George,&rdquo; continued the other. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
have any chums to do the pulling act; and so we
just had to flounder there for hours and hours.
I reckon we must have spent the best part of
two days sticking in the mud. Happened that
nothing came along but some big steamers; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
they wouldn&rsquo;t stop to help a poor little motor
boat off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how did you get away finally?&rdquo; asked
Jack, interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worked our way out of it by ourselves; and
we&rsquo;re proud to tell it,&rdquo; Clarence proceeded.
&ldquo;I managed to climb up into a tree that hung
over the boat, and threw down branches until
we made a mattress that would bear our weight.
Then we got out a block and tackle we carried,
and fixed it in a way to get a strong pull. I kept
the engine working for all she would go, while
Joe bent to the tackle; and inch by inch we finally
yanked the <i>Flash</i> out of her mud berth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; remarked George, with real
emphasis. &ldquo;Looking back, there&rsquo;s always some
satisfaction in remembering how you managed
to get out of a bad hole by means of your own
wits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, we wished many times we had
some chums handy, who would give us a pull,&rdquo;
said Joe, whom the meal and hot coffee had put
in a better humor.</p>

<p>All night long the storm raged on the lake.
Any vessel that was so unlucky as to be caught
out in it was to be pitied, or at least those aboard
were. Morning saw its abatement; but the seas
were beating wildly against the rock bound
north shore and it was sheer folly for any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to dream of putting out while such a condition
of affairs lasted.</p>

<p>So they concluded to make a day of it. Clarence
for the first time in his life began to realize
what fine fellows these motor boat chums really
were; and how they stood ready to forget all the
trouble that he and his crony had been only too
willing to shower upon them in the past.</p>

<p>They talked of dozens of things, some of which
were connected with their life in school at home,
and others that bore upon the recent series of
happenings on the St. Lawrence river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like we wouldn&rsquo;t have any more bother
with Clarence after this,&rdquo; said Josh to Herb, as
they watched Jack and the other two doing something
at the camp fire that afternoon, just as
though the best of friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but you
never can be sure of Clarence. He&rsquo;s tricky; and
besides, impulsive. Just now he means to drop
all enmity toward us; because we&rsquo;ve fed him,
and treated him white. But wait till something
rubs him the other way. That&rsquo;s the time to see
if the thing is more than skin deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the midst of their conversation George
purposely mentioned the name of Jonathan
Fosdick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What; do you know the old apple grower,
too?&rdquo; demanded Clarence, looking surprised.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course Jack told how they had found the
old man sick in his stable; and helped him to his
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he told us all about his runaway boy,
Andy, too; and how word came he was working
in a fishing camp up along this shore,&rdquo; George
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we promised that if we ran across the
fellow we&rsquo;d tell him he was wanted at home the
worst kind,&rdquo; Clarence remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he was that thankful he just loaded us
down with stuff&mdash;eggs, butter, and such.
Couldn&rsquo;t do enough for us,&rdquo; Joe added, grinning
at the recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;History repeated itself then, for we promised
the same thing,&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he just wouldn&rsquo;t take a cent in payment
for the things we got,&rdquo; remarked George. &ldquo;But
see here, Clarence, it looks like we&rsquo;re in for another
race between the <i>Flash</i> and the <i>Wireless</i>,
to see which can get to the mouth of the Agawa
first; for I hear there&rsquo;s a big fish camp there, run
by a man at the Soo, where they take tons and
tons of white fish, the trout not being for sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I get the notion that&rsquo;s struck you,
George; and let me say right here, I still believe
the <i>Flash</i> to be the better boat,&rdquo; Clarence went
on, stubbornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we try it out then, tomorrow, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
leave here; in a friendly way of course, I mean?&rdquo;
George asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take him up, Clarry!&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then, we&rsquo;ll call it a go,&rdquo; declared
the other. &ldquo;Only I wish we had something
worth making a run for, a prize of some sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will give me some pleasure to be the one
to tell Andy Fosdick that he&rsquo;s wanted bad at
home,&rdquo; George observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll call it a go; and this time you&rsquo;d
better look out for yourself, because the <i>Flash</i>
has had a knot an hour added to her speed since
we raced last. And besides, I didn&rsquo;t have any
heart in that trial of speed, you know. That
smuggler was forcing me to run my boat, to get
him out of a pickle; and for me to win only meant
that my boat would be lost to me. I was really
glad to play him a trick in the end, and throw
the race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack and George may have had their own
opinions with regard to the truth of the matter;
but they knew enough to keep their tongues
still. While the dove of peace hovered over the
camp, it would be folly to stir these fellows up
again.</p>

<p>Overhead the sun shone in a clear sky. Only
for those waves the motor boat club could have
easily continued on their cruise. But with the
waning of the afternoon the seas began to sensibly
decline.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I prophesy a good day tomorrow for our race,
George,&rdquo; Clarence remarked, as, in company
with the others he sat by the fire, enjoying a
feast that Josh and his assistants, Nick and
Jimmie, had prepared for the crowd.</p>

<p>Jack and George were both of the same opinion
since all the well known signs seemed to point
that way. They sat up until a reasonable hour,
chatting and singing; and Clarence realized as
never before what a fine thing he and Joe were
missing in never having found a chance to join
this merry group before.</p>

<p>The night was a peaceful one. At early dawn
the camp was astir, for much had to be done ere
they might put out on the calm lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a big mirror; didn&rsquo;t I tell you that
wind had blown itself out?&rdquo; remarked Clarence,
upon casting his first glance beyond the point.</p>

<p>At eight they were all ready to leave the snug
harbor that had opened so opportunely for the
storm threatened crew of the <i>Flash</i>.</p>

<p>Clarence had charts also, and doubtless studied
them eagerly when he had an opportunity to go
aboard his boat again. For although this was
only a friendly race, he always threw himself
into whatever he did with a vim, heart and soul,
that made defeat all the more bitter, should it
come.</p>

<p>Of course Jack, deep down in his heart, knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
full well that this was only a temporary truce in
the warfare that had always existed between
himself and Clarence. Once away from their
society the other would soon drift back to his
old way of thinking and acting. But Jack decided
that not because of any unfriendly act on
the part of himself or chums should these two
find cause for again digging up the buried hatchet.</p>

<p>Leaving the cove, the four boats were soon
moving along the glassy surface of the calm lake,
headed almost due west. Somewhere, many
miles away, lay the first goal, the mouth of the
Agawa, which was to mark the expiration of the
race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready, both of you?&rdquo; demanded Jack, as
the two rival speed boats ranged alongside the
<i>Tramp</i>, one on either quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready here!&rdquo; answered Clarence, briskly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here, Jack!&rdquo; called George, hovering
over his engine, which was running at about its
next to slowest notch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go!&rdquo; shouted the starter; and instantly
both craft shot forward like arrows, while the
rattle of their exhausts sounded as if a battle
were in progress.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;WIRELESS DAY&rdquo;</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Josh, wildly excited, and
glad for once to be on the narrow speed boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the best one win!&rdquo; called Jack, as he
watched the rivals drawing ahead of the two
slower boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means us!&rdquo; laughed Bully Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait and see!&rdquo; answered Josh; between
whom and Joe there had always been more or
less bad blood.</p>

<p>Herb had given his staunch engine all it could
stand; and as the <i>Tramp</i> stood by him, they were
soon left far in the lurch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk to me about speed,&rdquo; observed Herb, as
Jack turned his face that way, &ldquo;strikes me the
<i>Wireless</i> has her work cut out for today, to beat
Clarence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard what he said about the improvement
made when at the machinist&rsquo;s. It was a
knot an hour increase, I believe,&rdquo; Jack remarked,
casting a look down at the throbbing motor of the
<i>Tramp</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Herb spoke up. &ldquo;But you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
know we did some tinkering to George&rsquo;s engine,
and he has always said that it ran better afterwards.
Anyhow, it looks like a pretty race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so with you, Herb,&rdquo; Jack admitted.
&ldquo;Judging from here, they&rsquo;re running neck and
neck now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t forget
that tricky Clarence is always up to something.
Two to one he&rsquo;s got a bit more speed held in
reserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, George knows him like a book,&rdquo; laughed
Jack. &ldquo;And make up your mind he&rsquo;ll keep
something held back himself. Don&rsquo;t you remember
he did before? Possibly Clarence may
be the one to run up against a surprise after a
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the racers drew farther and farther away,
those in the other boats began to think of other
things. None of them had half the interest in
the outcome of the rivalry as did George. With
him there were many old accounts to square; and
he meant to make a good job of it, if he had his
way about the matter.</p>

<p>For some miles the two speedy motor boats
kept along, neither appearing to gain half a
length on the other. If one seemed to be going
ahead, the skipper immediately busied himself
stopping the advantage. It was as if both were
holding themselves in for the home stretch.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Josh was on needles and pins all this while.
He paid little attention to what lay in the rear.
Part of his time was taken up in scanning the
watery waste ahead, through the powerful marine
glasses. And when not thus employed he
sat there, quivering with suspense, wondering
whether there would come a sudden stoppage of
the engine, which might spring from one of its
eccentric tantrums.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, the motor seemed to be
doing its best today, as if bent on meriting all the
good things its builders had said in their catalogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; suddenly hoarsely whispered Josh,
in a mysterious way, as though he did not wish
those in the other craft to overhear him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the little bay at the mouth of the
river?&rdquo; queried George, setting his teeth hard
together; for he knew that the crisis so long
awaited was at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, look for yourself, George,&rdquo; handing him
the glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; returned the
skipper of the <i>Wireless</i>, as he once more turned
his attention to his engine. &ldquo;Now, get in the
middle of the boat, Josh, and don&rsquo;t move any
more than you can help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to open up, then?&rdquo; asked the
tall, ungainly lad, feverishly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am. Are you ready?&rdquo; George went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hair is parted exactly in the middle, I
believe,&rdquo; chuckled Josh. &ldquo;You know Buster
used to say that was one thing you made him do
when he was on board here. Let her go, George!
Get the jump on him; it may count in the end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shout from Bully Joe was the first knowledge
Clarence had that his rival had taken the bit
in his teeth, and shot ahead. Instantly the speed
of the <i>Flash</i> was increased; and the two powerful
engines began to throb like little giants; while
the sound of the exhausts, from which the mufflers
had been entirely removed, was like the tattoo
of a couple of snare drums calling the long roll.</p>

<p>Josh steadied himself as best he could; though
when the boat was rushing through the water at
this frightful speed it did not seem so cranky as
when at rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George, we&rsquo;re gaining on him!&rdquo; he said, in a
husky voice that trembled with the excitement
under which Josh labored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see we are; and still I could get a bit more
out of old <i>Wireless</i> if hard pushed. Don&rsquo;t worry,
Josh; we&rsquo;re bound to show Clarence up for a
bluffer this time, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only something don&rsquo;t happen!&rdquo; gasped the
anxious Josh, with an intake of breath that was
like a big sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make your mind easy on that score,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
George, positively. &ldquo;Nothing is going to break
down. She&rsquo;s running as smooth as silk, and
never missing a stroke. Oh! ain&rsquo;t this great,
though? I&rsquo;ve looked forward to this ever so
long. Wouldn&rsquo;t I like to be close enough right
now to see the look on Clarence&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as long as a foot rule, I warrant you!&rdquo;
chuckled Josh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know them two fellows
though? They take a beat hard. Ten
to one that if you are ahead when we come to the
bay, they&rsquo;ll go on past, and never enter at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, that wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one
little bit,&rdquo; remarked George.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely was the <i>Flash</i> falling behind,
or rather the other boat forging ahead. Doubtless
Clarence must be trying every device known
to ambitious racing skippers in order to just
coax a little more speed from his engine; but it
was now keyed up to top-notch, and utterly incapable
of doing a particle better.</p>

<p>Already Clarence must know that he was
badly beaten, unless fortune stepped in to bring
about an accident to the <i>Wireless</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s playing for now,&rdquo; said
George, when his companion suggested this very
thing. &ldquo;But I reckon Clarence will find himself
barking up the wrong tree. This race has just
got to be mine. You hear me warble, Josh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not often George spouted slang; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
excitement had seized upon him to such an extent
now, that he hardly did know what he was saying.</p>

<p>Minutes crept along.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Flash</i> was a stone&rsquo;s throw in the rear,
and losing all the while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Careful about the turn, George,&rdquo; cautioned
Josh, as they came near where the bay opened
up. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to lose this thing at the
last stretch. Now you&rsquo;re safe to turn in. Hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah! siss! boom! crash! we win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Wireless</i> safely made the turn, and thus
Josh announced her victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you,&rdquo; Josh went on. &ldquo;Look
at &rsquo;em, George! They&rsquo;re spinning on right past,
and don&rsquo;t mean to come in at all. Clarence
won&rsquo;t even look this way, but keeps staring
ahead. Talk to me about taking a beat to heart,
there never was a fellow as bad as Macklin, in
baseball, hockey or any sport. Well, good-bye
to you, fellows! Come again when you can&rsquo;t
stay so long. It&rsquo;s <i>Wireless</i> day, you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer to the shout with which
Josh wound up his remarks. He saw Bully Joe
wave his hand in a derisive way, and then the
<i>Flash</i> passed by at full speed, as though the race
were still on.</p>

<p>There was a big camp on the shore, and several
boats drawn up on the beach. Many signs told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that this was one of the favorite places along the
north shore for the white fish men to gather.
Doubtless innumerable barrels of this delicate
inhabitant of the Great Lakes were shipped from
this coast during each season; with the supply
still undiminished.</p>

<p>It had been agreed upon that George was not
to go ashore until the rest of the little motor boat
fleet arrived. This was not for half an hour or
so, since the <i>Comfort</i> was not capable of doing
better than ten miles an hour, and the more
speedy <i>Tramp</i> had to accommodate her pace to
that of the steady boat.</p>

<p>Nick and the rest gave the victor a good cheer
as they turned the point, and entered the bay at
the mouth of the famous trout river.</p>

<p>Then the three craft made for the beach, off which
they anchored, to go ashore in the smaller boats.</p>

<p>There were some shanties and tents in sight,
with a number of rough looking men; who however
seemed glad to welcome the boys. The
smell of fish was everywhere, as was natural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to have a young fellow here
in this camp by the name of Andy Fosdick?&rdquo;
Jack asked a man who seemed to be the boss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but just now he&rsquo;s out at work. There&rsquo;s
a boat coming in and p&rsquo;raps Andy may be one
of the crew,&rdquo; the other replied.</p>

<p>They waited until the boat landed, and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
who were in it jumped out. Jack could use his
judgment, and he immediately selected a sturdy
looking young chap, with a skin the color of an
Indian&rsquo;s, as the one they sought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, fellows,&rdquo; he said to his chums;
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made straight for the young man; who,
seeing the procession approaching, and all eyes
glued eagerly on him, stood there looking curious,
and a bit apprehensive, Jack thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Andrew Fosdick?&rdquo; Jack asked, as
they reached the spot where the other stood, one
hand resting on the edge of the boat, from which
his comrades were already shoveling their catch
of fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name, though I generally answer
to plain Andy,&rdquo; replied the fisherman wondering
doubtless what all this meant, and why these
boys should want to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick. &ldquo;Found him the
first shot! We&rsquo;re sure in great luck on this
cruise, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him what you want with him, Jack,&rdquo;
urged Herb, who saw the other was being consumed
with anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come straight from your father,
Andy,&rdquo; said Jack, softly. &ldquo;He wants you to
come home to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they saw a hard look pass over the dark
face of Andy Fosdick.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use, boys,&rdquo; he said, bitterly. &ldquo;He
run me off long ago, and I don&rsquo;t go back there
again. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; to forget my name even is
Fosdick, and that settles it.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3>CAUGHT NAPPING</h3>


<p>Jack was shocked at the words and manner
of the young fisherman. His chums even half
turned away in disgust, believing that their
mission was doomed to failure. But Jack did
not give up a thing so easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, quietly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you
know, Andy. When did you hear from home
last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never once,&rdquo; gritted the other, morosely,
showing that his wrongs had eaten into his very
soul. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to, neither. Made up my
mind I cud take care of myself. Done it too, all
these years. Got money laid up; and goin&rsquo; to be
married in the fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t know your mother was
dead?&rdquo; Jack went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy, starting, and showing
signs of emotion. &ldquo;I never heard that Ma was
gone! Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t see her again.
She was never so bitter as dad; but only weak
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack heard him sigh, and knew a start had
been made.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Andy,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;your father is
subject to strokes. One of them will carry him
off. It may be today, or tomorrow, but not a
great while can he stay here. He is bitterly
sorry for what he did. He wants to tell you so,
to ask you to forgive him before he too dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy&rsquo;s head fell on his broad chest, and Jack
believed he saw his frame quiver with some sort
of gathering emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has made his will, and left you everything,
Andy,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;If you are to be married,
that will be your home. He begged us to
find you, to tell you all this; and that if you would
only come back to forgive him, he would die
happy. Won&rsquo;t you do that, Andy? Once he
goes, the chance can never come to you again;
and you&rsquo;re bound to feel mighty sorry as the
years go by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick nudged George, and whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the beat of that, George?
Ain&rsquo;t our Jack the born lawyer though? He
ought to be in your dad&rsquo;s office, studying for the
bar, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your horses, Buster!&rdquo; answered the one
addressed, eagerly waiting to see what effect
Jack&rsquo;s logic might have upon Andy.</p>

<p>The struggle however was short. Presently
the young fisherman glanced up; and as soon as
he could see the look on his bronzed face Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
knew his case was won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to the old man,&rdquo; he said, firmly.
&ldquo;I guess &rsquo;taint right he shud die and not have
a chance to say what&rsquo;s on his mind. And thank
ye for tellin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when will you go?&rdquo; Jack continued.
&ldquo;There is need of haste, because nobody can say
just how long he may live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boat&rsquo;ll be along this arternoon, and we ship
some barrels on her. Guess the boss&rsquo;ll let me
off when he larns the reason,&rdquo; Andy replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like, I&rsquo;ll tell him the whole story?&rdquo;
Jack suggested.</p>

<p>And this he did a little later. He found the
boss full of sympathy, rough man as he seemed
to be. And Andy readily received permission
to break the contract he had made for the
season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s doing now?&rdquo; queried Herb, as
the bunch wandered around, observing the various
interesting phases of the fishermen&rsquo;s business;
for a boat was loading with barrels full
of the catch, which were going direct to the Soo,
from where they would be carried by express to
Chicago, or other distributing points.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late to go on today,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Besides,
I want to have a try with some of the big
speckled trout that they tell me lie around here.
They take plenty, but have to throw them back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
or eat them, as the law does not allow any sale
of trout. Think of a seven pounder on my rod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, get at it then, Jack,&rdquo; laughed George.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be happy till you do hook a monster.
We&rsquo;ll promise to help you eat him, all
right; eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All he can bring in, and then some,&rdquo; declared
Nick; making his mouth move in a suggestive
way that caused his mates to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Buster,&rdquo; warned Herb. &ldquo;You
know you said you meant to cut down on your
grub. Instead of losing, you&rsquo;re gaining weight
every day. If you keep on like that, Rosie
won&rsquo;t know you when we get back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nick only grinned as he replied calmly:
&ldquo;Well, Rosie ain&rsquo;t the whole thing. There
are others, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to the traitor, would you?&rdquo; exclaimed
Josh. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I tell on him, though, when we get
back? I bet he&rsquo;s thinking right now of that
cute little elephant, Sallie Bliss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; admitted Nick, brazenly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
got a better right, tell me? And even you admit
that she is cute. Just mind your own business,
Josh Purdue. The fact is, you&rsquo;re just green with
envy because of my noble figure. Pity you
couldn&rsquo;t have a little of my fat on your bones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble figure!&rdquo; exclaimed Josh, pretending
to be near a fainting spell. &ldquo;Shades of my ancestors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
excuse me! I may be envious, but I ain&rsquo;t
conceited, like some people, and that&rsquo;s the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack left them in this sort of warm argument;
but he knew that no matter what was said, Nick
and Josh would not openly quarrel.</p>

<p>He asked numerous questions as to the most
likely spots for the big trout; and having secured
some bait, started into business. While thus
employed he saw the steamer come along, and
the boat loaded with barrels go out to meet her,
as she stopped her engines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Andy stepping aboard, carrying his
grip,&rdquo; Jack said to himself. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad he
proved so sensible. The old man will be wild
to have him again. Yes, it was a lucky day for
him in more ways than one when we started for
his house to get a supply of butter, eggs and
milk. Nick thought the luck was all on our
side; but he can never see far beyond meal
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the afternoon grew on, and the steamer became
hazy in the distance, Jack began to have
some bites. And then came the thrilling moment
when he found himself engaged with one of
those famous monster speckled beauties for
which this region is noted, and specimens of
which he had seen in the breeding ponds of the
Soo government fish hatchery.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a glorious fight, never to be forgotten;
and at last Jack had his prize in his hands. Nor
did the luck stop there. The fish were hungry,
apparently; for in less than five minutes Number
Two gave him even a harder struggle than the
other victim; and in this case also Jack won out.</p>

<p>So they did have trout galore for supper; and
even Nick was surfeited for once. All of the
boys declared that they had never tasted anything
finer than these big Lake Superior trout,
freshly taken from the icy waters of the big
reservoir, and cooked as only Josh Purdue could
do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yum! yum!&rdquo; Nick went on, after being actually
pressed in vain to have another helping;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stay right here for a month. Seems
to me I&rsquo;d never get tired of that pink flesh trout.
Don&rsquo;t ever want to hear mention of a Mississippi
catfish again after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Canada kitties?&rdquo; asked Herb,
maliciously.</p>

<p>Nick declined to answer. That was a subject
on which his comrades knew his mind full well;
and he did not mean to argue it again.</p>

<p>Mutely he pointed to the skin of the lynx which
had fallen to his gun, mutilated a little, to be
sure, by the charge of shot that had been the
means of its death; but worth its weight in silver
to the fat Nimrod; and Herb closed up like a
clam.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning they prepared to go on again;
though Herb and Jack had, when by themselves,
seriously talked over the subject; and were beginning
to arrive at the conclusion that this
tremendous fresh water sea was hardly the best
cruising ground for such small craft as the motor
boats; and that they would be wise to cut short
their former intention of reaching Duluth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better keep an eye out for dirty weather,
boys!&rdquo; the boss of the camp had observed, when
shaking hands as they said good-bye.</p>

<p>Nick could see no signs of anything ahead that
looked like a storm; and he was inclined to believe
the other must be wrong in his guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be one of them old croakers we hear
so much about,&rdquo; he remarked to Herb, as they
went on along the coast of the Big Lake. &ldquo;Always
expecting things to happen that don&rsquo;t come to
pass. I don&rsquo;t see any storm, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a sign,&rdquo; replied the skipper of the <i>Comfort</i>;
who was anxiously keeping tabs on his
engine, as though he had reason to fear a repetition
of the former trouble.</p>

<p>But in the end it proved to be George who
brought the little expedition to a halt. After
acting so splendidly in that fierce race with the
<i>Flash</i>, lo and behold, the motor of the <i>Wireless</i>
broke down during the early afternoon.</p>

<p>They tinkered at it for an hour and more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Jack coming over to take a hand; but apparently
little progress was made. Jack was worried.
They were too far away from the fish camp to
think of towing the disabled boat back; and a
harbor did not offer within reaching distance beyond.</p>

<p>The afternoon began to wane, and there
seemed nothing for it but that the three motor
boats should anchor just where they were, and
pass the night on the open water. All would
be well if the weather remained fair, and no
strong southerly wind arose during the night.
Jack did not like to think what might happen in
case such a thing did come about.</p>

<p>So as night came on they made things as snug
as possible, ate supper aboard, and determined
to keep up their courage, in the belief that nothing
would happen to alarm them.</p>

<p>But about an hour after midnight Jack, being
on the watch, was thrilled to hear a sudden and
entirely unexpected boom of thunder.</p>

<p>Instantly everybody was awake, and stirring;
loud voices began to be heard, as the others
thrust their heads out of the tarpaulin covers
that served as boat tents when the crews slept
aboard; and excitement reigned.</p>

<p>The very thing that Jack had dreaded most of
all seemed on the verge of coming about; since
they were caught on the open lake at night, with
a storm threatening.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>A NIGHT OF ANXIETY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hey! here&rsquo;s Nick getting into his cork jacket
already!&rdquo; called Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the one in question, firmly.
&ldquo;Think I want to get washed out on that pond
without something to hold me up? Remember,
I&rsquo;m a new beginner when it comes to swimming.
And then I&rsquo;ve got more to hold up than the rest
of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, help me get this tent down first,&rdquo; remonstrated
Herb. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be caught
by a storm with these things up, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it might rain?&rdquo; Nick protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it. We&rsquo;ve got oilskins; and perhaps
there&rsquo;ll be plenty of time left to get into the
same. Take hold there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herb was right; and the crews of all the little
motor boats had already started to stow away
the big covers. Jack kept things as snug as
possible aboard the <i>Tramp</i>, in case of a downpour;
and that was not at all the thing he feared
most.</p>

<p>They were within fifty feet of cruel looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
rocks. If the wind broke out from any quarter
that would send the big billows churning against
that barrier, the fate of the motor boat fleet
could be easily guessed.</p>

<p>In a little while everything had been done that
seemed possible; after which they could only sit
there, and await whatever was to be handed out
to them.</p>

<p>Nick and Josh were plainly nervous; and even
Jimmie showed some signs of apprehension, nor
could they be blamed for this timidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if one of the boats is swept away?&rdquo;
suggested Josh; who, being in the narrow-beam
<i>Wireless</i> understood that he had much less
chance for safety than those who manned the
other craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger of that happening,&rdquo; Jack replied,
quickly. &ldquo;The only thing we have to fear is
being smashed up against these rocks. Our
boats would cave in like puff balls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; Josh went on. &ldquo;Perhaps fellows,
we ought to go ashore in the dinkies while
we have the chance. Even if we lost the boats
we&rsquo;d save our lives. And I promised my folk
at home I wouldn&rsquo;t take any unnecessary risks,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But George only sniffed at the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There you go just
as usual, magnifying the danger, Josh. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
me, I&rsquo;m going to stick like glue to this old <i>Wireless</i>.
Just see me deserting her because a little
squall chances to blow up. Get ashore if you
feel like it. And you too, Buster; only remember,
if we should be blown miles away, you two
fellows would be apt to starve to death in this
lonely region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said Nick, immediately.</p>

<p>If there was any chance of his starving, he
stood ready to accept all sorts of perils rather
than face that possibility. And doubtless George
knew all this when he put the case so strenuously.</p>

<p>Josh too decided that he did not want to go
ashore. If the others could stand the danger, he
would too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be so bad for us, fellows,&rdquo; observed
Jack. &ldquo;Because, if you look up, you&rsquo;ll
see that the clouds are coming from the land
side. And every bang of thunder up to now has
been from that direction too. The storm this
time doesn&rsquo;t mean to cross the lake, and hit this
shore. And unless it changes around, we&rsquo;ll be
protected from it by these very rocks we feared
so much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully! bully! Good for you, Jack!&rdquo; cried
Nick, as if greatly relieved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling so
much better I almost believe my lost appetite is
returning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s so, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; echoed Jimmie, with delight in his
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heard this long
while,&rdquo; remarked George, who despite his seeming
valor, was secretly much distressed over the
outlook.</p>

<p>The thunder increased in violence. Then
they heard the sweep of the wind through the
pines and hemlocks on the shore. And in less
than ten minutes the rain was pouring down like
a deluge.</p>

<p>They had secured things so that little harm
would be done. Still, the outlook was far from
attractive, with several hours of darkness ahead;
during which they must keep on constant guard,
not knowing at what minute the wind might
take a notion to veer around to some quarter,
that would send the waves dashing against the
rockbound shore so near by.</p>

<p>It seemed as severe a gale as the one they had
experienced only a short time before. Indeed,
Jack was of the opinion that the wind was even
greater, though they did not feel it the same way,
because of the shelter obtained from the land.</p>

<p>They would never be apt to forget that night,
no matter how time passed. Watching was
serious business for Nick; and three times he
was known to creep over to where Herb kept his
cracker bag, doubtless to interest himself in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
little &ldquo;snack,&rdquo; so as to briefly forget his other
troubles.</p>

<p>Nor did Herb have the heart to take him to
task about it. Their situation was so very distressing
that he could think of nothing else.
Every time the lightning flamed athwart the
black sky the boys would look out at the troubled
waters stretching as far as the eye could see; or
else send an anxious glance toward the grim
rocks that loomed up so very close over their
bows.</p>

<p>Hours seemed like days. Nick groaned, and
declared he ached in every bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think of me, then?&rdquo; demanded
Josh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re well padded; while I reckon my
poor old bones are going to stick through, pretty
soon. I dassent stand up, because George won&rsquo;t
let me; and you can. I wish you had my berth,
Buster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at last Herb declared that there were certainly
signs of dawn coming in the east. Every
eye was turned that way; and upon learning that
the news was true the boys began to take on
fresh hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; George said for the tenth time, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad of one thing, and that is we managed to
get my engine in working order last night before
supper. Goodness knows what a fix I&rsquo;d have
been in otherwise, if we had to put out to sea
when the wind changed.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! murdher! I hope it won&rsquo;t do the same!&rdquo;
exclaimed Jimmie, who overheard the remark,
and was filled with dismay as he surveyed the
wild scene that stretched away off toward the
southern horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we manage somehow to cook something
warm?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; immediately echoed Nick,
beginning to bustle around in the steady old
<i>Comfort</i>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all feel so much better if we
have breakfast. Nothing like a full stomach to
put bravery in a fellow, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how brave you must feel all the time,
then!&rdquo; observed Josh, sarcastically.</p>

<p>But Jack knew that this time the fat boy spoke
the truth. When people are wet and shivering
things are apt to look gloomy enough; but once
warm them up, and let them eat a hot meal, and
somehow a rosy tinge begins to paint the picture.</p>

<p>They knew just how to go about the matter;
and those wonderful German Juwel kerosene
gas stoves filled the bill to a dot; as Nick declared,
after the delightful aroma of boiling
coffee had begun to reach his eager nostrils.</p>

<p>And while the wind still howled through the
pines up on the high rocks, and the billows rolled
away toward the south, growing in size as they
drew farther off shore, the motor boat boys sat
down to a tasty breakfast.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, this isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; observed Nick, as he
started in on what had been dished out to him
by Herb, who this time had done the cooking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be for the boss if he don&rsquo;t get to work
in a hurry,&rdquo; Josh flung across the watery space
that separated the boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry on my account,&rdquo; laughed Herb.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a mortgage on the balance in the fryingpan,
and he&rsquo;d better not touch it on his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think the bally old storm is over, Jack?&rdquo;
asked Nick, presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is, and I believe the wind
seems to be dying down a little,&rdquo; came the ready
reply, as Jack swept the heavens with anxious
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that last gust came out a little
more toward the west,&rdquo; remarked one of the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to know that,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;For
old sailors say that when the wind backs up into
the west, after being in the north, without going
all the way around, it means a return of the
storm, from another quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough to get ashore yet!&rdquo; muttered
Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, if you want to,&rdquo; George said
grimly. &ldquo;Take some grub along, if you make
up your mind that way. But I don&rsquo;t stir out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of this boat unless I&rsquo;m thrown out. Understand
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later, and Jack saw that his worst
fears were realized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s getting around fast now, fellows,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; Herb admitted; for he had been
noticing the increased roughness of the water for
a little while back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What must we do, Jack?&rdquo; asked George, with
set teeth, and that look of determination in his
eyes that stood for so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold out as long as we can,&rdquo; came the reply
in a steady voice. &ldquo;Then, when the danger of
our being dashed against the rocks grows too
great, we&rsquo;ll just have to up-anchor, and start
our engines to moving. It will be safer for us
out yonder than so near the shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another half hour went by. Then the little
boats were pitching and tossing violently, as the
full force of the onrushing waves caught them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand it much longer, Jack!&rdquo; called out
George, who was having the most serious time
of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we might as well make the move now
as later!&rdquo; called Jack. &ldquo;So get going, both of
you. And remember to stand by as close as you
can, so that we may help in case an upset happens
to any boat.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course George knew his chum had the
cranky <i>Wireless</i> in mind when he said this; but
the peril was not alone confined to the one boat.</p>

<p>Accordingly the engines were started, the
anchors gotten aboard after a tremendous
amount of hard work; and the little motor boat
fleet put to sea, with the intention of trying to
ride the storm out as best they might.</p>

<p>If the engines only continued faithful all might
yet be well.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>PERIL RIDES THE STORM WAVES</h3>


<p>There were anxious hearts among the young
cruisers as they started to leave the vicinity of
the shore, and head out upon the big heaving
seas.</p>

<p>So long as they could keep the boats&rsquo; bows on
the danger would not be so great as if they tried
to turn; when those foam-crested waves would
strike them sideways, and threaten to turn them
on their beam-ends; which would mean destruction.</p>

<p>The motors sang like angry bees whenever the
little propellers chanced to be exposed after a
retreating wave had passed. This was where the
greatest peril lay; for the strain on the engine and
shaft was terrific at such times, owing to the
rapid change of pace.</p>

<p>So Jack, Herb and George found themselves
compelled to stick constantly at the job, manipulating
the lever, so as to shut off power with
each passing wave.</p>

<p>They did not make fast time away from the
shore; but at the end of half an hour had reached a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
point where it seemed the height of folly to go
farther.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it, George?&rdquo; Jack sang out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything moving smoothly over here so
far,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Herb?&rdquo; continued the commodore
of the fleet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fault to find, only it&rsquo;s hard work; and I
hope we don&rsquo;t have to keep it up all day,&rdquo; replied
the skipper of the <i>Comfort</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is going to happen,&rdquo; Jack
observed. &ldquo;Seems to me the wind is dying
down. When that happens, the waves must
gradually grow smaller. Perhaps by afternoon
we may be able to proceed, and hunt for a harbor
farther along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; George remarked. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be sorry any, let me tell you, fellows. I&rsquo;ve been
balancing here like a circus acrobat this blessed
hour and more, till my legs are stiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of me, would you!&rdquo; bleated Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks! you&rsquo;re like a ball, and nothing ought
to hurt you!&rdquo; declared Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got feelings, all right, though,&rdquo; the fat
boy protested. &ldquo;But I certain do hope we get
our feet on solid ground right soon. I&rsquo;d just
love to see a fire going, and smell the hickory
wood burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s something more than hickory wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
you&rsquo;re longing to smell, and we all know it for
a fact,&rdquo; Josh fired back at him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they one and all did find encouragement
in what Jack had stated. The
wind was certainly beginning to die out; and
while as yet there could not be any appreciable
difference noted in the size of the rollers upon
which they mounted, to plunge into the abyss
beyond, that would come in time.</p>

<p>During the morning that followed the boys
who handled the engines of those three little
power boats found occasion to bless the makers
of the staunch motors that stood up so valiantly
under this severe test.</p>

<p>They had taken on an additional supply of
gasoline while at the Soo, and there was little
danger of this giving out. Still, as Nick said,
this energy was all wasted, and reminded him
of soldiers &ldquo;beating time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now and then the boys were able to exchange
remarks, especially the three who were not kept
busy during this time.</p>

<p>Jack listened to what was said, and while he
made no attempt to break into the conversation,
he gathered from it that at least Nick, Jimmie
and Josh were about ready to call the westward
cruise off, and turn around.</p>

<p>So he made up his mind that the matter must
be threshed out the very next time they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
gather around a fire on shore. As for himself,
Jack was thinking along the same lines, and
ready to go back to Mackinac Island&rsquo;s quiet
waters, in the straits between Lakes Huron and
Michigan.</p>

<p>Noon came along, to find them still buffeting
the waves; but there had been a considerable
change by then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we&rsquo;ve had a bite,&rdquo; called out Jack, at
which Nick instantly showed attention; &ldquo;I think
we&rsquo;d better make a start out of this. The waves
you notice no longer break, and while your boat
would roll more or less, George, I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;d be in any great danger of turning turtle,
do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m only too willing to put out,&rdquo; came
the answer. &ldquo;Anything but this horrible marking
time. I like to see the chips fly when I use
an axe. I want to see results. And here, this
blessed little motor has been churning away for
hours, without getting away from our old stand.
Yes, let&rsquo;s eat and run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be bad for digestion,&rdquo; spoke up
Nick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in hurrying over meals.
I was warned against doing it, unless I wanted
to waste away to skin and bones like Josh here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can take as long as you like,&rdquo; said
Herb; &ldquo;only get busy now, and dish up anything
you can find. There&rsquo;s some cold baked beans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
handy; and open some of that potted beef; it
ought to be tasty with the crackers and cheese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the job right off,&rdquo; declared Nick.
&ldquo;You know you never have to hurry me about
getting things to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe that&rsquo;s why your digestion is so good,&rdquo;
said Herb, sarcastically; but the fat boy only
grinned as he crawled back to where the eatables
were kept.</p>

<p>Later on they did head more toward the west,
and start moving through the swinging seas.
Constant watchfulness became necessary, for
there was always danger that in some unguarded
moment one of the billows might roll a boat
over like a chip.</p>

<p>So they kept going on, constantly varying
their course to meet emergencies, and making
progress along the coast. It was splendid
man&oelig;uvring for the young pilots of the motor
boats; though they rather thought they had had
quite enough of it, and would be only too glad to
call a halt.</p>

<p>Jack was watching the shore line ahead, whenever
he could, in order to learn if a haven came
in sight. He had Jimmie frequently use the
glasses when they were on a wave crest; and
kept hoping to hear him cry out that he believed
he had sighted the harbor they hoped to make
before night came on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>As the waves still further diminished in size,
they were enabled to make better time, since
they no longer feared an upset. Indeed, about
the middle of the afternoon they ceased entirely
to head the boats into any billow; and all of
them declared that they felt proud of what had
been accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack!&rdquo; called out George, as the two
boats happened to draw near each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; answered the one addressed,
popping his head up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does it come, d&rsquo;ye suppose, that we
haven&rsquo;t seen a blessed steamer all this morning,
going in either direction?&rdquo; George went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Because they had
warning from the weather bureau that a storm
was coming, and delayed starting out. These
captains know what it is to meet up with a Lake
Superior storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke up Jimmie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only the nervy
little boats like ours that laugh at all the blows
as comes along. Look at us, would ye, smashin&rsquo;
through the big waves like the sassy things.
Slap! bang! and come again, would ye? Sure,
it&rsquo;s weather on&rsquo;y fit for motor boats, it do be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed George, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all mighty
brave about now; but I tell you boys, I felt
squeamish for hours when the storm was on. I
knew what would happen to us if the wind whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
around before morning. Excuse me from
another experience like that. Wonder where
Clarence and Joe were then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, they did go on,&rdquo; Jack remarked.
&ldquo;I hope they had shelter. I wouldn&rsquo;t want my
worst enemy to be wrecked on such a terrible
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short time later Jimmie cried out again:
&ldquo;There do be a steamer comin&rsquo; along there,
Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steamer nothing!&rdquo; echoed Josh, who happened
to be using George&rsquo;s glasses at the same
time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching that thing for five
minutes now. And do you know what I think
it is, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Jack, who could not leave
his duties even for the minute that it would take
to glance through the glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wreck!&rdquo; exclaimed Josh, with thrilling
emphasis.</p>

<p>Then everybody sat up, and began to look
eagerly in the direction mentioned. It was far
out over the troubled waters; and the object
could only be seen when it happened to be lifted
on the crest of a wave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is that same, upon me worrd!&rdquo; cried Jimmie,
presently. &ldquo;I cud say the thing thin as
plain as the nose on me face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And boys, there&rsquo;s some kind of a flag floating
on it,&rdquo; Josh went on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Upside down?&rdquo; questioned Nick, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like it to me,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a wreck, all right; because that&rsquo;s
the signal of distress,&rdquo; Nick continued, now
raising Herb&rsquo;s glasses for a look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my! I believe it&rsquo;s them!&rdquo; he ejaculated a
minute later.</p>

<p>At that Jack could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Jimmie, you grab hold, and run this
boat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Keep her nose pointed just
as she runs now, and whatever you do, don&rsquo;t
swing around, broadside on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as Jimmie took hold of the wheel, the
skipper raised the glasses for a look, while George
awaited his report with ill-concealed eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, look now, Jack!&rdquo; cried Josh.</p>

<p>Presently Jack took down the glasses, and
there was a grave expression on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you see, Jack?&rdquo; demanded George.
&ldquo;Something that&rsquo;s bothered you some, I can tell
by the way you frown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sinking craft, all right, George,&rdquo;
replied the other, as he turned on all the power
his engine was capable of producing, and sent
the <i>Tramp</i> speeding directly into the waves.
&ldquo;More than that, I&rsquo;m afraid I did recognize it,
and, just as Nick said, it&rsquo;s the power boat, <i>Mermaid</i>,
carrying the banker, Mr. Roland Andrews,
and his party. Boys, we must hurry to their
rescue before they go down!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>PAYING THE PENALTY</h3>


<p>Immediately the little fleet of motor boats had
taken up a course leading directly for the floating
wreck. It looked like the height of folly for
such miniature craft to thus put boldly out upon
the bosom of that great inland sea; and nothing
save a call to duty would ever have influenced
Jack to make the venture.</p>

<p>They were strangely quiet as they continued
to buffet the oncoming waves. Once in a while
some one would ask the wielder of the marine
glasses what he could see, and in this way all were
kept informed.</p>

<p>Nick was trembling, so that there were times
when he could hardly hold the glasses to his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see her!&rdquo; he suddenly shouted in rapture.
&ldquo;Sallie&rsquo;s still there, fellows! I can tell her among
the lot. There, she sees me, I think, for the
darling is waving her handkerchief! She wants
me to hurry along, fellows; perhaps the blessed
waterlogged power boat is getting ready to dip
under! Can&rsquo;t you throw on just a little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
speed, Herb? Please do, to oblige me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one thought to laugh, nor did Josh come
up true to his name just then; for somehow they
seemed to understand that it was a grave matter,
and no time for joking.</p>

<p>Jack could see the figures on the partly submerged
boat with the naked eye now, they were
getting so close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see the other girl, Rita Andrews?&rdquo;
he asked Jimmie; and was more pleased than he
cared to show when the Irish boy answered in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I only hope we get there in time!&rdquo;
groaned Nick, as he fumbled at the cork life preserver,
as though intending to put it on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with that thing,
Buster?&rdquo; demanded Herb, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get it around me,&rdquo; the other replied, unblushingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t need it; there&rsquo;s not the least
chance of our upsetting now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Nick responded, calmly;
&ldquo;how do I know but I may have to jump overboard
after Sallie? She might slip in her great
joy at seeing her preserver so near. And a pretty
fellow I&rsquo;d be not to keep myself ready to do
the hero act. Besides, Herb, how do we know
that the bally old boat mayn&rsquo;t take a notion to
duck under, just when we get close by? I believe
in being prepared.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Buster,&rdquo; nodded the skipper.
&ldquo;Take my cork jacket too if so be you think
you&rsquo;ll need it. But please don&rsquo;t go to jumping
over just to show off. You might drown before
her very eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll be careful, Herb. But since you say
so, I believe I will keep your cork affair handy.
She might need it; because you see, Sallie is no
light weight, any more than me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crouched there waiting, doubtless counting
the seconds as they passed, and anxiously taking
note of all that went on in the quarter whence
they were headed.</p>

<p>Jack himself grew more nervous the closer they
drew to the wreck. He realized that those on
board were in extreme peril; for the powerboat
seemed to be gradually sinking lower, inch by
inch. At almost any time now it might give one
tremendous heave, and then plunge, bow first,
down in many fathoms of water, perhaps dragging
some of the people aboard to death.</p>

<p>But at the same time Jack was figuring just
how he and Herb must approach the wreck on
the leeward side, where it would in a measure
protect the small motor boats from the sweep
of the seas. Here they would be able to take
aboard as many of the imperiled ones as the rescuing
craft could reasonably hold.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack also noted that there was a large lifeboat
on the sinking craft. Possibly the oars had
been swept away, rendering the craft helpless
and useless. But if it could only be launched,
the crew might occupy this, and be towed to
safety by one of the little motor boats.</p>

<p>He fashioned his hands into a megaphone,
while Jimmie tended the engine for a minute, and
in this way called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have that boat launched. It will hold the
crew, and we will give them a tow to the shore.
Quick, sir; you have no time to lose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw the captain of the powerboat, still
wearing his uniform, though without the jaunty
blue cap that had once been a part of his makeup,
give hurried orders. Then the lifeboat was
shoved off the low deck, being held with a rope.</p>

<p>And a few minutes later the <i>Tramp</i> and the
<i>Comfort</i> hauled in close under the lee of the big
powerboat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies first!&rdquo; sang out Nick, as he balanced
himself so as to be able to render any needed assistance.</p>

<p>Greatly to his joy Sallie seemed to choose the
<i>Comfort</i> as her refuge. Perhaps she recognized
the fact that it was by all odds the largest of the
three motor boats, and hence more suitable to
her heft. But it would be hard to convince Nick
that this was the true reason. She saw him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was willing to entrust herself in the charge of one
who bore himself so gallantly.</p>

<p>Jack meanwhile had the pleasure of assisting
the pretty and vivacious little Miss Andrews,
whose first name was Rita, into his boat; to be
followed by another lady passenger, and then the
banker himself. The balance of the passengers
managed to embark on the <i>Comfort</i>. George
stood by, and offered to take one or two; but no
one seemed to particularly care to entrust themselves
on such a wobbly craft.</p>

<p>The captain and his little crew entered the
lifeboat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, everybody get away as quick as you
can!&rdquo; called the man in uniform, &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s
going down any minute. Make haste, or we
may be drawn under by the suction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George had taken the long rope attached to the
bow of the lifeboat, and fastened it securely to
a ringbolt at the stern of his <i>Wireless</i>. He now
started away, as did the other rescuing craft.</p>

<p>And none too soon was this man&oelig;uvre accomplished.
Hardly had they gone ten boat lengths
before a little shriek from Sallie announced that
the final catastrophe was about to take place.</p>

<p>There was an upheaval of the sinking powerboat,
a tremendous surge, and then only bubbles
and foam on the surface told where the unlucky
pleasure craft had vanished.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Miss Andrews cried a bit, perhaps because
of the nervous excitement; but her father
cheered her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Rita,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The boat was
insured, and we can get another and better one
when we want it. But for this season I think
we&rsquo;ve had about enough of the water. I tell
you we ought to think ourselves fortunate to have
these fine fellows come out to us just in the nick
of time. We&rsquo;ll never forget it, will we, girlie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon Jack was delighted to see the tears
give way to a bright smile, as Rita looked at him,
and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How queer it seems,&rdquo; she remarked demurely,
a little later. &ldquo;First Jack had to save my hat
from a watery grave; and now he has rescued
poor little me. Yes, I mean that he won&rsquo;t forget
us, dad. And I hope that we&rsquo;ll see him some
time at our Oak Park home, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and influence him, and also his
brave chums, in whom I find myself deeply interested.
Come to think of it, I fancy I already
have something of an acquaintance with a Mr.
Harvey Stormways, belonging in the town Jack
calls his home. The one I met in Chicago was
a banker, and a very clever gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my father,&rdquo; said Jack, rosy with
pleasure to think that his parent already knew
Rita&rsquo;s father.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on they discovered a landing place and
managed to get ashore. All of them were delighted
to once more set foot on solid land after
their recent harrowing experiences.</p>

<p>And such a night they made of it. The captain
had wisely secured a lot of stores before
leaving the wreck of the <i>Mermaid</i>, so that there
was little danger of any famine. Besides, as
George said, aside, any camp that had been able
to withstand the raids and assaults of a Buster
all this while, would not be caught without
plenty of eatables in the larder.</p>

<p>Around the camp fire they even made merry,
since no lives had been lost in the wreck. Mr.
Andrews told how they had escaped the first
storm, only to be caught in the second, and
rammed by some floating object, the nature of
which they could only guess.</p>

<p>The pumps were manned, but by slow degrees
the water had gained on them in spite of all their
herculean efforts. And as we have seen, only
for the coming of the motor boat boys a tragedy
might have followed.</p>

<p>In the morning Jack promised to take them out
to the first steamer that could be signalled, the
crew in the lifeboat being towed behind the
<i>Comfort</i>.</p>

<p>This he did, assisted by Herb.</p>

<p>And the balance of the young cruisers stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
on the wooded bank, waving their hats and
cheering as long as they could make their voices
heard.</p>

<p>Nick was as happy as any one had ever seen
him. Sallie had seemed to be fairly smitten
with the charms of the fat boy, or else fancied
having some girlish fun out of the meeting and
their one trait in common; for she certainly had
hovered near Buster since breakfast time, &ldquo;making
goo goo eyes at him,&rdquo; as Josh declared. And
now Nick, wishing to be in a position to see better
than his chums, took the trouble to laboriously
climb a tree that hung far out over the water.</p>

<p>Here, high above the heads of the rest, he sat
and waved his red sweater, as an object that
must attract the sparkling eyes of Miss Sallie
longer than an ordinary hat, or white handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray! hurray!&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his
voice; but perhaps Buster may have been too
violent in his gestures, or else neglected to maintain
his grasp on the limb; for suddenly there
was an awful splash, and the fat boy vanished
out of sight in the lake, which happened to be
fairly deep close up to the shore.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3>ANOTHER SURPRISE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the row about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buster&rsquo;s fallen in again! Somebody get a
rope, and lasso him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he comes up! My! what a floundering
time! He may be drowned, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jack knew better, and only laughed as he
replied to Herb:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that he&rsquo;s still wearing that lovely
cork life preserver. It gives him such a manly
look; and Buster thinks it adds to the admiration
of a certain young lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime there was a tremendous lot of
splashing going on in that little basin just under
the big tree, where Nick had been perched at the
time of his tumble.</p>

<p>Both arms were working overtime, like a
couple of flails in a thrashing bee; while his
chubby legs shot back and forth after the manner
of an energetic frog. All the while Buster was
spouting water like a miniature geyser; for his
mouth had happened to be wide open at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the time of his unexpected submersion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw me a rope, somebody!&rdquo; he spluttered,
as he continued to make manful efforts to keep
from sinking. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye stand there gaping
for? Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m in danger of drowning?
Hurry up your cakes, you sillies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no doubt but that Nick believed
every word he spoke; for he was making a tremendous
display of energy that would long remain
a topic for wonder among his comrades.</p>

<p>Herb started to scurry around to find something
that would be available in the rescue line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, the poor fellow may be partly stunned,
and unable to keep up much longer. Help me
find a rope, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he cried, as he passed the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Herb, now watch how easy it is
to save a drowning man,&rdquo; and as Jack said this
he turned to where Nick was making a young
Niagara Whirlpool Rapids of himself, and called
sternly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buster, stand up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lo; and behold, when the imperiled fat boy
proceeded to obey this command the water
barely reached to his chest. Looking rather
crest-fallen and sheepish he started to wade
out of the lake; while the boys burst into a roar
that must have even been heard by those on
board the steamer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick was in a rather pugnacious humor, for
him, as he arrived dripping on the bank. Perhaps
the merriment of his mates had something
to do with it; but the chances are he dreaded
lest a pair of laughing blue eyes on the departing
steamer may have witnessed his ridiculous upset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who pushed me in?&rdquo; he demanded, as he
gave vent to another upheaval of water. &ldquo;Tell
me that, will you? It was a mean trick, and he
ought to be ducked just as bad as I was. Seems
like a pity a fellow can&rsquo;t just sit up on the limb
of a tree to wave good-bye to a pretty girl without
some envious rival putting up a game on him.
Who did it? I dare him to tell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats! you&rsquo;re away off your base, Buster!&rdquo;
cried George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit raising the lake that way, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
complained Josh. &ldquo;Want to flood us out of our
camp, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buster, nobody was near you when you fell,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there was one of us
within ten feet of the tree. And besides, you
were up out of reach. You let go both hands and
slipped. It was your own fault. And we didn&rsquo;t
help you out because I knew you had on that
cork thing; besides, the water wasn&rsquo;t over your
head, as I found out some time ago. So don&rsquo;t
accuse anybody of being mean.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And next time you want to take the middle
of the stage just let us know. You gave us an
awful jolt,&rdquo; remarked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if I&rsquo;d had heart disease I&rsquo;d have dropped
flat,&rdquo; vowed Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! let up on me, can&rsquo;t you, and don&rsquo;t rub
it in so hard?&rdquo; grumbled the dripping Nick.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got to go and get these duds off. And
it&rsquo;ll take a long while for &rsquo;em to dry. Nice way
to use a new suit, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s lucky for the trade that you&rsquo;ve
come up here.&rdquo; Herb put in. &ldquo;The clothing
business will take on a boom soon. What with
Canada pussies, and upsets into the lake, you
can get away with more suits than the rest of
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got another bunch of clothes
along,&rdquo; whimpered Nick, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s sure too
chilly to run around without anything on. Jack
won&rsquo;t you help me out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I can lend you a pair of trousers,
Buster, if you can get into them. Don&rsquo;t forget
that fine red sweater you possess. Josh, pull it
down from that branch, will you? So you see,
you&rsquo;ll get along till these duds dry out,&rdquo; replied
the one addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But stick to the camp while you&rsquo;re wearing
that sweater, Buster,&rdquo; warned Josh. &ldquo;Perhaps
there ain&rsquo;t any cows around here; but even a bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
moose would want to boost you up in a tree if he
ever saw that rag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll hug the fire, all right; don&rsquo;t you worry
about me, Josh Purdue,&rdquo; was the fat boy&rsquo;s reply,
as he made off, the water still oozing from
his soaked garments in streams.</p>

<p>Jack wisely put in the balance of the morning
fishing, and with abundant success, as was evidenced
from the fact that they had another delightful
fish dinner that noon, Josh serving the
trout in his usual tempting manner, crisp and
brown.</p>

<p>As his clothes had meantime dried, through
the action of combined sun and camp fire, Nick
gradually became himself again. It took considerable
to upset his good nature; and the boys
never could fully decide whether he had been in
earnest concerning that episode of the &ldquo;great
splash,&rdquo; or simply pretending to be indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, what&rsquo;s the programme?&rdquo; asked
Jack, as, having eaten until they could no longer
be tempted, they sat back to talk over the future
activities of the motor boat club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; remarked George, seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to the conclusion that we&rsquo;re making a mistake
in cruising over such big water as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; called Nick, clapping his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boats as small as ours seem out of their element
on an ocean,&rdquo; continued the skipper of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<i>Wireless</i>, steadily. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right in such
places as the Thousand Islands, where plenty of
harbors are in sight all the time. But just think
what might happen up here. Suppose the wind
had chopped around the other night, instead of
kindly holding off till morning. What would
have happened to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; remarked Herb; &ldquo;we all know the
answer to that riddle, George. Since we couldn&rsquo;t
well make out into the open lake in the storm
during darkness, why, every boat must have
been smashed against the rocks. Makes me
shiver to just think of it; and that&rsquo;s right, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one or more of us might have gone
under.&rdquo; George went on. &ldquo;Now, when we
got permission to make this cruise we promised
not to take unnecessary risks&mdash;am I right, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you are, George. Hit up the pace, will
you? Buster here is getting sleepy, waiting for
the verdict,&rdquo; Josh said, after his customary
fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to offer a suggestion; and if
Jack says so, I&rsquo;ll put it in the form of a motion,&rdquo;
George continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it a motion without all this fuss and
feathers,&rdquo; observed Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I move, then, that we abandon our original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
intention of knocking along this north shore of
Superior till we arrive at Duluth, where we
could ship our boats home. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay us
for the trouble and the danger. It&rsquo;s a barren
country. If we had an accident there&rsquo;s no place
to have repairs done short of several hundred
miles. In a word, fellows, this is no hunting
ground for little motor boats. Besides,&rdquo; with a
sly glance toward Nick, &ldquo;what if our grub gives
out, as it&rsquo;s likely to do at any time, once Buster
gets to feeling himself again; why, we might
starve to death, fellows, in the midst of plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard the motion, fellows&mdash;that we
change our programme, and give up this Lake
Superior trip. All in favor say aye!&rdquo; Jack remarked.</p>

<p>A chorus of assents followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contrary, no!&rdquo; went on the commodore; but
only silence followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Motion is carried unanimously,&rdquo; Jack went on.
&ldquo;And now, let&rsquo;s consider what is to take the place
of this trip. We&rsquo;ve still got some weeks ahead
of us, the fishing&rsquo;s fine, and we&rsquo;re a long way
from Milwaukee. Somebody suggest something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George and Jack had of course talked this
thing over more than once recently. So no one
was surprised when the former immediately
jumped up, and began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For one, I&rsquo;m of the opinion we couldn&rsquo;t do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
better than return over part of the way we came.
Between the Soo and Mackinac Island there&rsquo;s
fine cruising ground to be explored. We can
take a different route part of the way back
through the St. Mary&rsquo;s River, and perhaps find
new mud banks, with a few more strange animals
on the Canada side. Besides Jack says the bass
fishing is just great in some places they told him
about at the Soo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Me for the St. Mary&rsquo;s then,&rdquo; Nick
shouted, to hide his confusion at mention of
strange beasts, for of course he knew what that
referred to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prospect of the merry bass frizzling over
the coals coaxes Buster,&rdquo; declared Josh; &ldquo;but
on general principles, fellows, I don&rsquo;t see how we
could improve on that programme. Count me
in on it, George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any other suggestions?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;If
there are, now is the time to speak up, before
we decide our plans. We can settle on just the
day we ought to leave Mackinac for the run
down Michigan to Milwaukee, and so get home
on the dot. How is it, fellows? Do I hear
another scheme offered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it unanimous, Jack,&rdquo; said Herb. &ldquo;You
know we&rsquo;re pretty much of one mind; and we
ought to get all the fun going out of that
programme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we start back tomorrow?&rdquo; said Jack.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Right after breakfast,&rdquo; Josh added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick. &ldquo;I hope
none of you would be silly enough to ever think
of leaving here before breakfast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that will never happen, so long as we
have an alarm clock in the bunch. We depend
on you, Buster, to warn us when it&rsquo;s time to eat
our three meals a day,&rdquo; George said blandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I didn&rsquo;t expect that of you George,&rdquo;
remarked Nick. &ldquo;But if you really mean it,
thank you! I&rsquo;m glad to know I&rsquo;m of some use
to the crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Buster, we wouldn&rsquo;t know how to keep
house without you,&rdquo; remarked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would we be after doing with the leftovers?&rdquo;
ventured Jimmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how would I keep my big boat evenly
balanced?&rdquo; demanded Herb. &ldquo;Sure you fill
a place in the circle, Buster, and a very important
one. We&rsquo;d miss you if you ever gave up
the ship, and took the train back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I promise you I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; smiled Nick;
&ldquo;at least so long as you keep up the same sort
of bill of fare we&rsquo;ve had today. Yum! yum!
what&rsquo;s the use of wasting a fine piece of browned
trout like that? I call it a wicked shame.
Here, Josh, don&rsquo;t you dare throw that away.
Set it aside on that nice clean piece of birch bark.
Somebody might get hungry later on, and enjoy
a bite.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>This standing joke of Nick&rsquo;s clamorous appetite
seemed never to lose its edge. The rest
of the boys could always enjoy seeing him make
way with his share of the meal. In fact, had a
change come over the fat boy, they would have
felt anxious, believing him sick.</p>

<p>So Jack went back to his fishing, of which he
seemed never to tire, and the others found something
to employ their time and attention while
the afternoon sun dropped lower toward the
western horizon.</p>

<p>By now the Big Lake looked like a lookingglass,
so still had the waves become. A haze prevented
them from seeing any great distance away&mdash;one
of those mid-summer atmospheric happenings
that are apt to develop at any time when the
weather is exceedingly warm.</p>

<p>Evening came at last, and they sat as usual
around the camp fire, having enjoyed the meal
Josh and his willing assistants, Jimmie and Nick,
had placed before them. Everything looked
favorable for getting off in the morning; and
should the lake remain calm Jack believed they
might be able to make the Soo by another night.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without the slightest warning
a disturbing factor was injected into this quiet
restful camp. Jack thought he heard a sound
like a groan near by, and raised his head to
listen. Yes, there was certainly a movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
at the west side of the camp, as though something
was advancing. And as he stared, his
hand unconsciously creeping out toward the
faithful little Marlin shotgun, a figure arose and
came staggering toward the group.</p>

<p>Loud cries broke out as the boys scrambled
to their feet. And there was a good excuse for
their consternation; for in this ragged, dirty, and
altogether disreputable figure they recognized,
not a wandering hobo, but Bully Joe, the crony
of Clarence Macklin!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h3>TO THE RESCUE</h3>


<p>Joe Brinker was a sorry sight as he staggered
forward, and fell almost at the feet of Jack. He
certainly looked as though he had been through
a rough experience since last they saw him with
Clarence aboard the <i>Flash</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Joe!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, as though he
had just recognized the intruder.</p>

<p>Jack had jumped forward, and was now bending
over the newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Josh, any hot coffee left in the pot?&rdquo;
he demanded, seeing that the other looked utterly
exhausted, as though he might not have partaken
of food for many hours.</p>

<p>Josh immediately poured out a cup, and
handed it to Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit up here, and swallow this, Joe,&rdquo; said Jack,
supporting the fellow with one arm, and holding
the tin cup to his lips.</p>

<p>Joe eagerly gulped down the warm drink. It
seemed to do him a world of good right on the
spot; for when a cup of hot tea or coffee is available,
it is utter folly to think strong drink is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
necessary in reviving a chilled or exhausted
person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that tastes fine. Got any more, boys?
I&rsquo;m nearly starved,&rdquo; he exclaimed, almost crying
with weakness.</p>

<p>Already had Nick hurried over, and seized
upon several cold flapjacks that possibly he had
placed away, against one of his little bites between
meals. Surely Nick ought to know what
an awful thing hunger was. One of the most
dreadful recollections of his life was a time when
he had been compelled to go all of eight hours
without a solitary scrap of food passing his lips!</p>

<p>Soon Joe was devouring the flapjacks with the
eagerness of a hungry dog, to the evident delight
of Buster, who always found pleasure in seeing
any one eat heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell us what happened, Joe?&rdquo; said Jack,
after they had watched the other make away with
the last scrap, and look around for more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t you see we&rsquo;re just crazy to hear?&rdquo;
Josh exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get caught in that storm?&rdquo; demanded
George, suspecting the truth.</p>

<p>Joe nodded his head in the affirmative, and
they could see a shudder pass over his form, as
though the remembrance was anything but
cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the <i>Flash</i> must have been wrecked?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
George went on, horrified as the remembrance
of Clarence&rsquo;s face came before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone to flinders!&rdquo; muttered Joe. &ldquo;Smashed
on the rocks, and not a scrap left to tell the story.
Gee it was tough, all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&mdash;was Clarence drowned?&rdquo; Nick gasped,
with awe-struck face; and quivering all over
like a bowl full of jelly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, neither of us went under,&rdquo; replied
Joe, promptly, to the great relief of all the boys.
&ldquo;But we came mighty near it, I tell you, fellers.
I&rsquo;m a duck in the water, you know, and I guess
I helped Clarence get ashore. He said I did,
anyway. And there we was, far away from
everything, with not one bite to eat, or even a
gun to defend ourselves against wild animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! that was tough!&rdquo; admitted Nick,
sympathetically; as he remembered his own exploit
when the Canada lynx invaded the camp,
and how useful the shotgun proved on that occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t the worst, fellers! There&rsquo;s
more acomin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Joe went on, shaking his head
solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My gracious! did wild animals get poor old
Clarence after all?&rdquo; George asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Joe went on, with set teeth, &ldquo;but a
couple of men did that was as bad as any wild
animals you ever heard tell of. They found us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
trying to make a fire to dry our wringing wet
clothes; and they just treated us shameful. See
this black eye I got just because I dared answer
back. They kicked poor Clarence like he was a
bag of oats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two men, you say?&rdquo; Jack asked, frowning
darkly. &ldquo;What sort of men could they be to
act like that toward a pair of shipwrecked boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They looked like lumber cruisers, or prospectors
that never struck it rich,&rdquo; Joe continued.
&ldquo;They had a grouch agin everybody. First
thing they took what money we had, and Clarence&rsquo;s
fine watch that was water-soaked and
wouldn&rsquo;t run. Then they found out who we
was by reading some letters he carried. I saw
&rsquo;em talking it over; and then they tied us to a
couple of trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I never heard of such a wicked thing!&rdquo;
ejaculated the startled Nick; whose mouth kept
wide open while he listened to this thrilling story
of Joe&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they meant to try and force
blackmail?&rdquo; asked the far-seeing George, whose
father was a lawyer, it may be remembered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They said something about him writing home
for more money to buy another motor boat,&rdquo;
Joe replied. &ldquo;And Clarence said he never would
do it, not even if they tortured him. But I&rsquo;m
afraid a few more kickings like they gave us will
break down his spirit.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you managed to escape?&rdquo; Jack went
on, wishing to learn the whole thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I worked loose, and slipped away when
neither of &rsquo;em was lookin&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered the ragged
and dirty figure. &ldquo;But give me some more
grub, fellers. I&rsquo;m starving, I tell you. They
refused to give us a bite to eat till Clarence agreed
to do all they wanted of him. Anything, so&rsquo;s
I can fill up. I&rsquo;ve got a hole down there that
feels like Mammoth Cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again it was Nick who hastened to procure
another stock of eatables, crackers and cheese,
or anything else that came handy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you escape, Joe?&rdquo; asked Jack,
seriously as though some plan had already
started to form in his active brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know for sure,&rdquo; replied the exhausted
one. &ldquo;Sometime after noon, though. They
was layin&rsquo; down and snoozing when I got free.
I wanted to find a knife, and cut Clarence loose
too; but the risk scared me. And Clarence, he
told me to hurry and get off for help. You see,
one of the men was sitting up, and rubbing his
eyes; so I just sneaked away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they follow after you, Joe?&rdquo; asked
George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never waited to see,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but
just cut stick, and hurried off. Oh! I&rsquo;ve had an
awful time getting along near the shore. Dassent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
get out of sight of the lake because you see
I was that scared I&rsquo;d get lost. I tumbled a
thousand times, cut my head and hands on the
rocks, nearly slipped into the lake twice, and
was just ready to lay down and die, when night
came on. Then I saw a fire over here, and just
managed to make the riffle. Give you my word,
fellers, if it&rsquo;d been half a mile more I never&rsquo;d got
to camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Clarence is still in the hands of those
two rascals?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon he is, &rsquo;less they saw fit to let him go
free; and from what I seen of &rsquo;em, that ain&rsquo;t their
game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far do you suppose that place was away
from here?&rdquo; came from careful George.</p>

<p>Joe sat silent for a minute. He seemed to be
trying to figure what manner of slow progress
he may have made since effecting his freedom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d gone nigh twenty miles, judgin&rsquo;
by the way I felt,&rdquo; he finally said; &ldquo;but come to
figger it out I reckon it mightn&rsquo;t abeen more&rsquo;n
five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toward the west, you mean; for you came
from that direction?&rdquo; Jack continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so, over that way,&rdquo; pointing as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Jack turned to his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us, boys,&rdquo; he said soberly. &ldquo;Clarence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
has never been one of us; but he belongs to
our school. We&rsquo;d never forgive ourselves if we
went back to the Soo tomorrow, and left him
in the hands of these scoundrels. Do you agree
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jack!&rdquo; sang out George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we would be cold-blooded to think of
it,&rdquo; Josh declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s my sentiments,&rdquo; Herb spoke up;
and both Nick and Jimmie nodded their heads
violently, to prove that they were in no way behind
their comrades in wishing to do a good deed
toward one who had long been an open enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s consider what way we ought to go
about it,&rdquo; Jack proceeded, with an air of business.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of the question for us to try and go
back the way Joe came. We couldn&rsquo;t make it
under hours; and from his looks none of us are
hankering after the experience. But there is a
way to get there quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boats?&rdquo; George put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One boat ought to carry all who will go, and
let that be the <i>Comfort</i>, with five of us on board,
taking the two guns to make a good show,&rdquo;
Jack proceeded.</p>

<p>Nick immediately set up a whine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I have feelings,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
I know you&rsquo;re just going to shut me out of this
rescue game? I&rsquo;m ready to do my part as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
as the next one, ain&rsquo;t I? What you want to
leave me behind for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to obey orders, Buster,&rdquo; said
George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides, with so many aboard, the bully
old <i>Comfort</i> might founder,&rdquo; Josh thought it
necessary to remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, you are going to have your share
of the work, and along a line you always like,&rdquo;
Jack went on; &ldquo;for while we&rsquo;re gone, it shall be
your duty to make a new brew of coffee, fill Joe
here cram up with all he can eat, and have
something ready for Clarence when we bring
him back. So you see, Buster, your duty is as
important as any of ours. Every one in their
particular line. You can&rsquo;t fight as well as Jimmie
here; but you do know how to provide against
starvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick smiled broadly again, entirely appeased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count on me, Commodore,&rdquo; he said, briskly.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that coffeepot right now? I&rsquo;ll do my
duty to the letter. Why, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to look
after the wants of a hungry fellow. It gives
me something of an appetite just to think of the
work I&rsquo;ve got cut out for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack put Nick and Joe out of his mind, after
trying to get a little information from the latter,
with regard to the character of the place where
the <i>Flash</i> had been wrecked, and the two hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
looking customers were supposed to be still
stopping.</p>

<p>They went aboard the <i>Comfort</i>. Jack himself
decided to run the boat, with the assistance
of Herb and George. Above all things, silence
was of more value to them just then than speed,
if they hoped to steal up on the captors of Clarence
without being detected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; called Nick, as the broad beamed
motor boat started quietly away.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Look! isn&rsquo;t that a fire over there?&rdquo; asked
sharp-eyed George, as he gripped Jack&rsquo;s arm
suddenly.</p>

<p>They had been moving cautiously along for
the better part of an hour, striving in every way
possible to avoid any drumming sound, such
as nearly always betrays the presence of a motor
boat near by.</p>

<p>And in all that time they may have only covered
some four miles, or possibly five; for no
effort was made to drive the <i>Comfort</i> at even
half speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; Jack replied, after a quick
survey. &ldquo;But how is it we didn&rsquo;t glimpse it
before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a point of rocks must stick out between,
and we&rsquo;ve just opened the pocket,&rdquo;
George replied, in a whisper.</p>

<p>Of course Jack had immediately shut off the
power, so that old reliable <i>Comfort</i> stopped her
forward movement, lying there on the dark
waters like a log; for not a light of any description
did they carry aboard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we go ashore now?&rdquo; asked Josh, softly;
for all of them had been warned not to speak
above a whisper from the time they started forth
on their errand of mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason
we&rsquo;ve been keeping so close in. I&rsquo;ll drop into
the dinky, and use the paddle. Foot by foot
I can pull the motor boat to shore, and then
we&rsquo;ll land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lucky there&rsquo;s not a breath of wind,&rdquo;
Herb remarked, as he helped Jack draw the small
tender alongside, and then crawl over the side.</p>

<p>Presently Jack was working away, having attached
the painter of the boat to a cleat at the
bow of the <i>Comfort</i>. His method of using the
paddle insured utter silence. Had it been an
expert hunter, moving up on a deer that was
feeding on the lily pads along the border of a
Canada stream, he could hardly have manipulated
that little spruce blade with more care.</p>

<p>And so, foot by foot, the motor boat was coaxed
in nearer the rock-bound shore. When Jack
had finally succeeded in accomplishing his end
he next sought some place where those still
aboard could disembark, and the <i>Comfort</i> be
tied up while they went about the business that
had brought them there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what next?&rdquo; asked Herb, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
entire five had reached land, and the boat was
amply secured to a split rock, with little danger
of any injury resulting, because there was no
wind and hence no movement to the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to advance,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;So as
to get around that point; when we&rsquo;ll see the
camp Joe told us about. Those fellows have got
a big rowboat, he said, but hate to work the
oars. He said they first talked of making the
boys do the rowing; and then that scheme for
getting more money came up. Are you ready
for the job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am that,&rdquo; said Jimmie, promptly, flourishing
a club that looked like a baseball bat; and
which would be apt to prove a formidable
weapon in hands that were as clever as those of
the stout Irish lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count me in,&rdquo; remarked Herb, who was carrying
a hatchet; having nothing else to serve him
as a threatening weapon that might strike terror
to the hearts of the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m only too anxious to look in on &rsquo;em.
Let me eat &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; Josh growled, flourishing
the camp bread knife in a most dreadful fashion.</p>

<p>George had his rifle, and of course Jack carried
the repeating Marlin shotgun which had proven
its value on many another occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come on, and be mighty careful, everybody,&rdquo;
Jack cautioned, as he led off.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>They remembered what Joe had said about the
&ldquo;rough sledding&rdquo; he had found in his endeavor
to keep close to the water&rsquo;s edge, so that he
might not get lost. And every one of the five
were willing to admit that Joe spoke the truth
when he told this; for they made the slowest
kind of progress.</p>

<p>Still, every yard passed over took them so
much closer to the goal. And so long as they
did not tumble and make a noise that would
warn the enemy, it mattered little or nothing
about the time they took in covering the ground.</p>

<p>After a long time spent in this sort of crawling
business Jack believed he could see what seemed
to be a fire flickering among the stunted trees.</p>

<p>Calling the attention of the others to this, he
changed his course a bit, in order to find an easier
route, and perhaps come upon the camp from
behind.</p>

<p>For tenderfeet the five boys seemed to be making
a pretty clever advance. They could now
see a man stretched at full length near the fire, as
if sleeping; though now and then a puff of smoke
told that he was only taking it easy, and indulging
in his pipe.</p>

<p>A little farther and they glimpsed the second
fellow. He towered up like a house, being all
of six foot-three, and bulky in proportion. But
then, as Jack well knew, a man is only a man, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
matter what his size, when he is looking into the
muzzle of a rifle and modern repeating shotgun.
And even this giant might well quail when
brought to book.</p>

<p>The boys were now creeping through the
bushes, and getting very close in. All the while
Jack was eagerly trying to see what had become
of Clarence. At first he could discover nothing
of the other; and became chilled with a deadly
fear that these cowards might have gone to extremes;
though he could hardly bring himself
to really believe it.</p>

<p>George was the first to find out what had been
done with the prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; he whispered close to Jack&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying on the ground over by that stump of
a tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guided by these directions Jack was enabled
to also place Clarence. There was certainly a
figure lying there, and it must be the companion
of Joe; for the latter had said there were only
two of the scoundrels.</p>

<p>Jack bobbed his head back in a hurry, after
he had made this little survey of the enemy&rsquo;s
camp. For the big man had arisen to his feet,
and started toward the very place where Clarence
lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be ready!&rdquo; muttered Jack, seeming to understand
that the crisis must now be very close
upon them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving at the spot, the giant bent over, and
they could hear his growl as he spoke harshly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made up yer mind yet, younker? Will ye
write thet letter jest as we tell ye, and let a
couple o&rsquo; honest though unfortunit men have a
square chanct to rake in a leetle pile? Speak
up, now, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He accompanied his words by a brutal kick
that gave Jack and George a spasm of anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; shouted the obstinate Clarence,
still undismayed; for his pluck was the best part
of him, and had always been.</p>

<p>At that the big brute raised his heavy boot
with ugly words. It was doubtless his full intention
to dash it against the side of the helpless
boy, regardless as to what the consequences
might be. But he changed his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I were you, mister!&rdquo;
said Jack, in an even, clear voice, as he and
George suddenly stood up in full sight.</p>

<p>He had covered the giant with his gun, and
George was ready to do the same for the man
with the pipe the instant he bounded to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand still, both of you, or we&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;
George shouted.</p>

<p>This was a signal for the other three who were
behind, and they suddenly made their appearance,
waving their crude weapons menacingly.</p>

<p>The two men were apparently taken completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
by surprise. They saw that the tables had
been suddenly turned. And somehow, although
these were only boys who confronted them, there
was a grim air of business about those unwavering
guns that neither of the cowards fancied at
all.</p>

<p>Jack had not known what the result was going
to be. He hardly anticipated that the men
would dare attack them in the face of those
weapons. And he had arranged with George
that should they show signs of flight, no one was
to raise a hand to prevent them.</p>

<p>When therefore the giant gave vent to a whoop
and turning, galloped toward the water&rsquo;s edge,
neither of the boys pulled trigger; though Josh
let out a shout as though he might be chasing
after; which he was not, all the same, for he did
not fancy the looks of either of the rascals.</p>

<p>The second man took to his heels also, dodging
to the right and left in a ridiculous manner, as if
expecting every second to hear the crash of
Jack&rsquo;s gun, and feel himself being peppered with
bird shot.</p>

<p>They could be seen tumbling madly into their
rowboat, and pushing out on the lake with all
possible speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go!&rdquo; said Josh, grandly, as he replaced
his bread knife in the leather scabbard he had
made for it, so as to avoid any chance of cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
his fingers by coming in contact with its keen
edge, when rummaging in the locker aboard the
<i>Wireless</i>, where the cooking things were kept.</p>

<p>Jack was already stooping over Clarence, and
in a jiffy had severed the cords that bound him
hand and foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful glad you came, Jack!&rdquo; said the
other weakly. &ldquo;I believe that coward would
have killed me if I didn&rsquo;t give in to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, work your arms and legs as fast as
you can, Clarence!&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to get out of this in a hurry now, or they might
even find the <i>Comfort</i>, and run away with her.
You&rsquo;re going back with us, you know. Joe got
in and told us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men having put what they thought
a safe distance between themselves and the boys,
began to shout insulting remarks, and make the
most terrible threats. Although they could not
be seen out on the lake, it was not so difficult to
know in what quarter they chanced to be at the
time.</p>

<p>Angered by the insults, as well as the cruel
manner in which they had treated Clarence and
Joe, George picked up the shot gun which Jack
had lain down for a minute, and before any one
could stop him had discharged it.</p>

<p>That some of the many little lead pellets in
that shell had stung the profane scoundrels in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
rowboat, the boys understood from the howl that
arose, followed by the splashing of oars, telling
that they were pulling madly away before a
second shot added to their troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now come with us, Clarence,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>They did not have to be so careful making their
way back to where they had left the steady
going old <i>Comfort</i>. And once aboard, the return
trip was quickly accomplished. In camp
Clarence was soon given all the food and coffee
he could manage; and he professed himself as
very grateful for all the motor boat boys had
done for him.</p>

<p>Since his speed boat had met with so tragic
an end, Clarence declared that he had had enough
of cruising, and would start straight home as
soon as they reached the Soo, if the boys would
lend them enough money to buy tickets&mdash;which
programme he and Joe carried out; nor were our
six friends at all sorry to see them vanish from
view.</p>

<p>Leaving the Soo, Jack and his chums spent almost
two weeks upon the crooked St. Mary&rsquo;s
river, camping, fishing and enjoying themselves
to the utmost. But never did they touch on
Canadian soil but that poor Buster seemed to be
dreadfully uneasy, sticking close to the fire, and
breathing a sigh of genuine relief when once more
afloat, with no unpleasant reminders wafted after
them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack and Nick had made up a little programme
for themselves, which they sprung upon their
comrades later, when leaving the three boats at
Milwaukee to be sent by rail to the home town
on the Upper Mississippi.</p>

<p>This was nothing more nor less than saying
good-bye to the rest of the boys in Milwaukee,
and taking a little run down to Chicago, &ldquo;to
see the sights, you know,&rdquo; as Nick cleverly put
it. But everybody guessed that the greatest
attraction which all Chicago could boast for the
deserters would be found within the borders of
Oak Park, and under the roof of the banker, Mr.
Roland Andrews.</p>

<p>And so the great cruise had finally come to an
end. Looking back the boys found no reason
to regret their course. True, there might be a
number of incidents that would stand out for
a long time with a bit of harshness; but time
mellows all such things; and even Buster would
laugh just as heartily as any of his chums when
his adventure with the bull, or the pretty Canada
pussy-cat, were mentioned.</p>

<p>They had had such a glorious time of it that
undoubtedly other trips must be talked over
during the coming winter; and with the coming
of the holiday season once again the motor boat
boys would be found ready to set out again on
their search for new adventures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Jocko went home with George and was a
source of considerable costly amusement in the
Rollins&rsquo; home.</p>

<p>We shall surely hope and expect to continue
the pleasant acquaintance formed in the pages
of the several books already published; and in
new fields accompany Jack Stormways and his
chums, with their gallant little boats, through
other scenes, where true American pluck and
endurance, such as they have always shown,
must carry them through all perils to success.</p>
